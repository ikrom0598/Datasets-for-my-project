This included an unrestricted $1.5 billion loan to Kazakhstan Development Bank and a restricted $3.5 billion. The agreement is for a period of up to 15 years. The agreement prohibits the DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets. The restricted portion of the China Ex-im Bank Facility is aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in metallurgy, chemical and oil industries. The funds of this credit facility will be used for investment projects of Kazakhstan companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China. The facility's expansion was expected to be completed in 2015. Under the restricted portion of the China Ex-im Bank Facility, on 12 December 2009, DBK entered into an individual credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for the amount of U.S.$884 million of which U.S.$874 million had been drawn as at 30 June 2017.

39030,TRUE,China,China Exim Bank provided USD259 million loan for Phase-I realignment of Karakoram Highway at Attabad Lake in Pakistan (linked to #35739),2010,OOF-like,"In December 2010, Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA) has signed a contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) for the realignment of KKH. The project involves the realignment the portion of the highway that was submerged under water during the Attabad landslide in 2010. The cost of the project was US$275 million. It was based on 85% funding in foreign currency from China Exim Bank's concessional loan, and 15% in local currency by the Pakistan government. The project included the realignment of roads, construction of 5 tunnels with total length of 7.12 km, 78 culverts and 2 bridges. The application for the loan is under process with Economic Affair Division (EAD). Work would be completed in 2 years after commencement subject to availability and release of funds. The project was completed on Sept 14, 2015. The final year book report by the Pakistani government for 2016-2017 records a Preferential Buyer's Credit loan of USD259 million and that the project was completed on 30-06-2017. STAFF_NOTE: The KKH highway had been updated previous to the realignment by China. For details on this project, see #35739. Note that the previous upgrading and the realignment of the KKH highway are jointly called the Phase-I project of KKH Highway. STAFF_NOTE: There is a significant portion of contradicting information on the transaction in Pakistani finance ministry's Economic Affairs Division Year Book reports. Coder did not code these information and deferred to the report mentioned above as the more reliable source. See below for these contradicting reports. A Pakistani ministry of finance monthly project status report in August 2016 records the project as a loan of CNY259 million, which is slightly smaller than the amount recorded above. Moreover, the source suggested that part of the loan was fulfilled in August 2016, which contradicts the source above suggesting that the project was complete on September 14, 2015. A Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2016/17 confirms the amount of 259 million USD, and also suggests that by 30 June 2017, 253.3 million of the total amount has been disbursed. It is therefore unlikely that the project has been finished, changed the project status to implementation. Stage 2 confirmation is needed here. According to Pakistan Ministry of Finance Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2015-2016, China is estimated to disburse 3,744.874 million Pakistani rupees to the project in 2014-2015, according to the revised budget estimate.

34509,TRUE,China,China provides funding for Parwan Irrigation Project (Linked to #34498),2004,ODA-like,"The Parwan Water Project is located 40-85 km north of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The northern plain of the project is the main producing area of ‚Äã‚ÄãAfghan agricultural products and is the granary of Afghanistan. The water conservancy irrigation project was assisted by the Chinese government and contracted by our company. It was officially started on December 31, 1968 and completed on December 31, 1976. The total length of the main canal is 85.578km, and the designed irrigated area is 24,800 hectares (372,000 acres). However, due to natural aging, disrepair and war damage, the entire Parwan water conservancy project was severely damaged, the water channel was unable to supply water properly. In order to help the Afghan people rebuild their homes, the Chinese government reached an agreement with the Arab side in May 2003 to decide to help the Parwan water conservancy project free of charge. The restoration project was divided into two phases: Phase-1: On 3 March 2004, at the Chinese Embassy in Kabul, Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi and Afghan Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment Minister Mohammad Yusuf Nooristani signed an agreement under which China would help rehabilitate irrigation canal in Parwan Province. The construction was implemented by the Jiangxi Province Water and Hydropower Co. Ltd. starting in March 2004, and the China International Water and Electric Corp. carried out the acceptance testing in June 2005. The project was officially completed and transferred in October 2006. The first phase of the project has a total price of $11.5 million, according to the information platform by the Shanghai Commerce Council. A news article published by People's Daily Online on 3 March 2004 mentioned that the first phase of the project would cost US$10 million. Phase-2: The second phase started at the end of December 2006 and ended at the end of December 2007. The same companies respectively carried out the construction and acceptance testing. It was also reported that China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) and Beifang Investigation ,Design & Research CO. LTD (BIDR) were involved in the rehabilitation project. Phase-2 Addition project: This was also undertaken by Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Co., Ltd., which was started on December 31, 2010 and completed on June 15, 2012. Based on the ADB report, the total cost for the project is US$15 million, which would be funded by China. In another news article published by the Chinese Embassy Website, the funding for the project was drawn from the US$150 million that China has pledged in 2002 and is a sub-umbrella project of #34498 instead of a duplicate. STAFF_NOTE: The financial breakdown of the phases is not yet clear, so it is captured under the same project for now.

The average 6 Month LIBOR rate in September 2010 was 0.478%. Total interest rate is therefore coded as 0.478% + 2.40%, or 2.878%. According to the Sri Lanka Department of External Resources, this project was completed on 9 September 2013. On 6 December 2009, The Sunday Times of Sri Lanka reported that the contract to rehabilitate (widen and improve) all adjunct roads in the North of Sri Lanka had been given to four different Chinese companies in 13 different packages.

The project is funded by a loan agreement with the Bank of China, under the guarantee of the CNPC. When the three fields are developed, they will produce 869.6 million cubic meters of natural gas for exportation and 6,400 tons of gas condensate for domestic markets annually. The project was scheduled to begin in 2014, but construction began on May 30th, 2017.

Construction of the pipeline was split into two stages. The first stage of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline, which comprises all sections of the Bozoi-Shymkent part, was completed in 2015, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 6 bcm per year. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. In December 2016, a second stage of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline project, comprising a linear part of the pipeline with a total length of 311.0 km, was completed. In November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, which increased the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. ICA has announced that, by the end of 2019, it expects the construction of repair and maintenance sites, shift camps and the Beineu gas measuring station, as well as the telecommunications and the highway system will be completed. Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP, a joint venture between JSC KazTransGas and China National Petroleum Corporation (each with 50% interest) was established on January 18, 2011 to construct and operate the gas pipeline. KTG is a transportation company, which owns a 100% interest in several domestic regional gas distribution companies and a 100% interest in ICA, which in turn operates the largest natural gas pipeline network in Kazakhstan. In December 2012, the joint venture entered into a $1.8 billion syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank and Bank of China. The loan was to finance the development, construction and operation of the Bozoi-Shymkent part of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline. In February 2016, certain amendments to this facility were signed. Amounts due under this loan facility bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.7% per annum until 30 December 2019 and, thereafter, at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.2% per annum. For this project, 3M LIBOR + 2.7% is taken to be the interest rate. The loan is repayable in installments starting December 2017 and matures on 11 March 2028. The loan is secured by corporate guarantees from the Company and CNPC. As at 31 December 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion (KZT 341 billion). Construction of the Bozoi-Shymkent part started in September 2011. The construction of the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent pipeline was first confirmed under the 'Agreement on cooperation in the construction and operation of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline', signed between the Governments of the Afghanistan and China on August 18, 2007. The agreement was then later amended on October 14, 2009. The Agreement on the Main Principles of Construction and Operation of the Kazakhstan-Chinese Gas Pipeline (AMP) was signed within the frame of the official visit of President Hu Jintao to Kazakhstan on June 12, 2010. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas deliveries to China pursuant to a contract concluded between KTG and PetroChina for the supply of 5 bcm of natural gas during the period from 15 October 2017 until 14 October 2018. The total estimated consideration under this agreement is U.S.$889.7 million. The price of gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement is linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. Negotiations are ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between KTG and PetroChina. BSGP and the Company expect the transportation of gas to China to increase in the coming years and, in order to facilitate such transportation, plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 (at an estimated cost of KZT 109.2 billion). See ‚ÄúManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Performance‚ÄîCapital Expenditures‚Äù.

EPTL is a Joint Venture Company of Engro Powergen China Machinery and Engineering Company(CMEC), Habib Bank Limited and Liberty Mills Limited. Thar Block II is a 95.5 square kilometer (km2) area of the Thar coalfield, which has total lignite reserves of 175 Billion tons which can be utilized to produce 100,000 Megawatt (MW) for over 200 years. The project will be fueled by coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which is developing a coal mine of 3.8 million tonnes per annum capacity beside the project. The coal mine project will cost 845,000 USD, and the EPC contractor is CMEC. Commercial Operation Date for Phase 1 of both Projects is expected to be in mid ‚Äì 2019. In December 2014, ICBC Karachi Branch submitted an expression of interest for debt arrangement of 825 million USD for the coal-based power project. According to the letter, the total project cost is expected to be approximately 1100 Million USD which will be funded in debt-equity ratio of 75:25. Accordingly, total equity requirement will be 275 Million USD. The majority of the equity investment for the project was expected to be from EPTL and its affiliates. According to EPTL's website, in 2015, financing agreements were signed in Beijing for both the power plant project and the mining project. Under these agreements, a syndicate of local banks committed to provide around USD 500 million for the mining and around 240 million USD for power plant. The local syndicate is led by Habib Bank Limited, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, National Bank Pakistan and Faysal Bank Limited. In addition, a syndicate of Chinese Banks consisting of China Development Bank, Construction Bank of China and ICBC are providing loans amounting to around 820 million USD for both projects. The World Bank's Private Participation in Infrastructure database reports that for the coal power plant, the 3 Chinese banks will each pay 207 million USD, with Sinosure providing a loan guarantee of 621 Million USD. According to a March 2015 NEPRA document, the interest rate of the loan is 4.95%. For determination of the upfront tariff, the repayment period was assumed to be 10 years, and the grace period was assumed to be the same as the construction period, which is 40 months. This project has thus recorded the loan details as such. In September 2017, it was reported project was in the process of dewatering three of the aquifers in the mine, with all challenges being addressed in a timely manner. The water drained from the three aquifers would recycled later for the That Coal Block-II power projects operational work. In December 2017, it was reported that half of the work on That Coal Block-II was completed and that the project is to be completed and functioning by August of 2019 and have a capacity of 1.32 gigawatts but divided into four mine-mouth power plants and mining 7.6 million tonnes of coal per year.",230,Energy Generation and Supply,NEW INFRA,Implementation,Commercial,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Pakistan,Pakistan,594588467.5,FALSE,TRUE,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=paprin0020010714dx6p00q6v&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020041203e0c100078&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020041019e0ag0000o&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CWI0000020050808e17p0000o&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020060119e21i0004k&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CWI0000020061127e2bd0000u&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://sindhcoal.gos.pk/projects/jv-project-between-gos-engro-group-block-ii/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tribune.com.pk/story/596701/raising-finance-sino-sindh-resources-gets-investment-to-develop-thar/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Pakistan_and_coal#China_to_invest_in_Thar, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dawn.com/news/1145855, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/26-Oct-2014/thar-coal-project-chinese-banks-reluctant-to-accept-sovereign-guarantees, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://sindhcoal.gos.pk/, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vults7c3kv89j45/BU_PITCH_ENGLISH_2018.xlsx?dl=0, Academic Journal Article; http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/3, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.cpecinfo.com/energy-generation, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.cpecinfo.com/news/cpec-project-updates-april-2018/NTE5Mw==, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/16605/MP%20CR%20TS%20XW.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/16605/MP%20CR%20TS%20XW.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/Annex_III_CPEC.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/8csdpteq2a5b3lj/2016%20Government%20of%20Pakistan%20Bond%20Prospectus.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www3.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2015/0428/ltn20150428394.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixypDGuIrhAhWQjFkKHeV2BXMQFjABegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decatalanen.nl%2F17218_tunnel%2Fmining%2Fof%2Fcoal%2Fin%2Fpakistan.html&usg=AOvVaw2ShPqPaeLIDmL0CQI_CUzl, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASMESG0020170911ed990000h&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks",23,"Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), State-Owned Company; China Development Bank (CDB), Government Agency; Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency; Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, State-Owned Company","China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) , State-Owned Company; GMC","Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, State-Owned Company",1,621000000,USD,1.044419853,1,621000000,,1-Jan-12,,1-Jan-18,1,770,665,Pakistan,PAK,PK,586,564,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Concessional,4.95,10,3.33,27.65,Thar,"Shamsuddin Ahmed Shaikh, CEO "
33431,TRUE,China,Colombo Port City Project - Phase 1: China Development Bank Loan (link to project ID #55528),2014,OOF-like,"On 16 September 2014, China Communications Construction (CCC) signed the Colombo Port City Franchise Agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, outlining an investment for the Colombo Port City Project (now known as the Colombo International Financial City). On this same day, China Development Bank signed an 805 million USD commercial loan financing agreement with CCC for this project (see attached 2014 article CDB). The 805 million USD loan from China Development Bank for the Colombo Port City Project is captured in this project. For details regarding the equity investment from CCC, see linked project ID #55528. The Colombo Port City Project is divided into two phases. The main components of the first phase are land reclamation of about 269 Ha (91 will be designated for public use such as recreational parks), a canal with a length of 2,000 meters and a width of about 70 meters, a breakwater with a total length of 3,245 meters (with sandbanks on both sides) and 10 Ha of beach, the construction and maintenance of the infrastructure, road sales and development of roads, green spaces, water supply and drainage, power supply, communications and other pipelines in the first phase of the planning area. The main components of the second phase are infrastructure construction of roads, green spaces, water supply and drainage, power supply, communications and other pipelines in the planned area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe second phase. According to the project company website, the key objectives of reclaiming 269 Ha of land are to create a regional business hub, with high quality public spaces and infrastructure facilities, to create a tourism hub with attractions such as shopping, culture and entertainment, to foster integrated living to provide high quality resident facilities and amenities such as parks, water sports, schools, hospitals, etc., and to generate investment in real estate development and service sector jobs (see 'FAQ' section of CHEC Port City Colombo website). The total investment for the project (phases I & II) is about 1.396 billion USD. The first phase investment is 1.15 billion USD, and the second phase investment is 246 million USD (see attached resource from CPPPC). The debt:equity ratio for the first phase of the project is 70:30. The debt component of the first phase of the Colombo Port City Project is financed by the 805 million USD China Development Bank loan (see September 2018 article from CCC), and the loan has a maturity of 10 years, including a 3 year grace period (see CPPPC article). This loan was provided by the Guangxi Branch of China Development Bank, and as of May 2017 CDB had disbursed 938 million RMB of the total loan amount (see July 2018 article from Guangxi Regional Government Office). CCC contributed to the equity component of the project, but the specific investment is unclear. The 2017 Government of Sri Lanka Bond Prospectus indicates that the total Chinese funding committed for the Colombo Port City Project was 1.337 billion USD, so it seems likely that the total investment from CCC for both phases of the project is 532 million USD. It is still unclear how phase two of the project will be financed, but the debt:equity ratio will again be 70:30. According to the 2017 Government of Sri Lanka Bond Prospectus, the Sri Lanka Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development has allocated approximately Rs. 94 million in 2017 to develop the infrastructure facilities of the proposed port city development project. Construction of the Colombo Port City project was launched on 17 September 2014 by Sri-Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaska and the Chinese President Xi Jinping, with 39 months planned for the completion of the project (see September 2014 articles from CHEC). Project construction was halted in January 2015 to receive proper permits and approvals. According to the CHEC website, a comprehensive back-to-work order was issued to the contractor on 13 September 2016, and the reclamation work formally began on 29 September 2016 (see October 2016 article from CHEC). Upon recommencement, the project was now known as the Colombo Financial City, instead of the Colombo Port City Project (see 2017 Government of Sri Lanka Bond Prospectus). On 16 January 2019 the completion ceremony of the 269 Ha land reclamation work was held, which was two months ahead of schedule (see January 2019 CHEC article). As of April 2019, the overall progress of the project was at 95% completion according to the project company website. The land reclamation progress was at 100% completion, the ground progress at 86% completion, and the breakwater progress at 91% completion (see CHEC Port City Colombo 'Master Plan'). To undertake this project, China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) set up the investment company CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd. This investment company is a 100% owned subsidiary of CHEC, and CCC is the parent company of CHEC (see 'About' and 'FAQ' pages of CHEC Port City Colombo website). All lands reclaimed by the Project Company will be owned by the Urban Development Authority of Sri Lanka. The Project Company would be allocated 116 Ha of the total saleable/marketable land, and the Government of Sri Lanka would be allocated 62 Ha of this land. The remaining 91 Ha is common land owned by the Government of Sri Lanka, which roads and parks. The Project Company will therefore enjoy commercial benefits from only 43% of the reclaimed land. The Government of Sri Lanka will lease the 116 Ha of marketable land to the Project Company for 99 years, after which time fresh 99 year leases may be granted to third party developers.

53832,TRUE,China,HDC Hulhumale Development Phase II - 7000 housing units,2017,OOF-like,"On August 14th, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) loaned 368.9 million USD (5,681,060,000 MVR) to the Housing Development Corporation (HDC) for the construction of 7,000 apartments in Hulhumale, which falls under the Maldives Housing Development Corporation's plan to build 15,000 housing units in Hulhumale (Hulhumale Development Phase II). The total project cost for the 7,000 housing unit development is 434 million USD, and Credit Suisse will provide the remaining 65.1 million USD. ICBC granted the loan to be paid within 15 years, with an interest less than four percent. At the end of September 2018, the disbursed outstanding debt was 209,076,877 USD. The project is being implemented by Maldives' state owned HDC and state owned China State Construction Engineering Corp. The total construction area is 451,900 square meters and the project includes 16 high-rise (25 story) buildings. The 7,000 social housing flats will measure 550 square feet each, featuring two bedrooms and two bathrooms. All construction materials such as steel and cement will be transported from China. As of November 20, 2017, the contractor had started the construction. The project is slated to be completed in 2019.

Based on an interview with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Yings, this was the second 150 million CNY-grant that was offered by China. The agreement to provide the first 150 million CNY worth of grant was signed on 31 December 2011 (See Project ID#34601). Minister Fu Yings also said that China and Afghanistan would identify projects that could use the grant. STAFF_NOTE: This project was initially coded as being a duplicate of ID #34601, however, according to information published on the website of China's ECCO in Kabul, 150 million CNY assistance packages were pledged consecutively in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the CSIS report that China's grant to Afghanistan from 2002 to 2010 is about US$205.3 million while the report by the 'Diplomat' has mentioned that the total amount of grant from 2002 to 2011 is about US$250 million. The reports show that there is at least 150 million CNY that was provided to Afghanistan in 2011, and the 150 million CNY that was offer in 2012 is referring to a separate pledge made by China. Last, the article by Reuters suggest that China's offer of 150 million CNY was part of the strategic partnership agreement signed in 2012, thus further distinguishing this offer of 150 million CNY in aid in 2012 from the one made in 2011. A Joint Declaration between The People's Republic of China and The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on Establishing Strategic and Cooperative Partnership was then released on June 16 2012 which stated that both sides will ""continually strengthen the pragmatic cooperation in such fields as resources and energy development, infrastructure development, engineering and agriculture"".

The terms of the concessional loan are 30 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2.25% interest rate. In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received the technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, would review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm would submit financial offer on completion of the review.

The government of Nepal has assigned the Inter-modal Transport Development Board to facilitate all the construction work which will be done by China‚Äôs Beijing Real Estate Group Company. Under the project, a border inspection building, cargo warehouse, litigation-warehouse, a parking lot with a capacity of accommodating at least 158 big containers and 33 cars and a 112-meter-long bridge over the Bhotekoshi River will be constructed. China had also agreed to upgrade a 6.5 km road connecting the dry port to the border with China. Construction began in December 2012 and was expected to be completed within 2 and a half years. The construction project is expected to ease the bottleneck for surging trade between China and Nepal. As of November 2014, the completion of the dry port will be delayed as a result of transportation problems created by a landslide in Jure, Sindhupalchok, and the sweeping away of the Bhotekoshi bridge by floods. The bridge was crucial to transporting construction materials to the dry port. The government has also failed to clear houses along the road connecting Miteri Bridge and the dry port. The road expansion and construction of a bridge over Bhotekoshi are included in the dry port contract. At this point only 60-65 percent of the construction work has been completed.

Sachal Energy Development (Ptd) Limited is 100% owned by Arif Habib Corporation Limited. According to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost is 130.481 Million USD. The project achieved commercial operation on April 10, 2017. The debt-equity ratio of the project is 80:20. Hydrochina Corporation is the Offshore EPC Contractor and Hydrochina International Engineering Company Ltd Pakistan is the Onshore EPC Contractor for this project. Goldwind provided 33 Wind Turbine Generators with a capacity of 1.5 MW each. Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd entered into a foreign facility agreement with ICBC China on February 15, 2015 for an amount of 100 Million USD.

The circular highway is located at the Colombo Metropolitan Region and passes through two administrative districts, namely Colombo and Gampaha. The Project consists of three main sections namely, Kottawa to Kaduwela (11.0 km) (Phase I), Kaduwela to Kadawatha (8.9 km) (Phase II), and Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (9.32 km) (Phase III). For the purpose of this project, only funding and details for Phase III are captured because China does not appear to have contributed funding to Phase I or Phase II. On 16 September 2014, EXIM Bank of China signed an agreement with Sri Lanka to provide a loan of 494.03 million USD for the third phase of the OCH. The loan accounts for 95% of the total project cost and has a 2% interest rate, with a 0.25% commitment fee and a one-off 0.25% management fee, as well as a maturity of 20 years including 5 years of grace period (ERD Performance Report 2014). According to the 2017 Sri Lanka Government Bond Prospectus, the estimated total cost of the project was 520.04 million USD. The remaining 5% of total costs would be covered by the Government of Sri Lanka (see 'Basic Project Details' from the Ministry of Highways). On 21 February 2013, Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) was awarded the contract for the Outer Circular Highway project. The project commenced on 1 January 2016 and is expected to be completed by 30 June 2019 (see 'Outer Circular Highway Project - Phase III' from Road Development Authority). As of 30 September 2018, the project was 75.9% complete. A 2017 progress report listed the project as behind schedule due to poor contractor performance.

According to the express tribune report, the western route of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), including the Khan-Zhob project, is going to be completed by the end of 2018 along with other 11 mega projects which were initiated in 2015-16. In January 2017, Pakistan's Under Communications Division provided 120 million Pakistani rupees for the Zhob Mughal Kot road. The division also contributed 40 million Pakistani rupees for the rehabilitation of DI Khan Mughal Kot road. As of Nov 2018, CPEC website only indicates that Feasibility and PC-I have been completed and the LOI has been forwarded to Chinese side. No other progress is indicated. A second CPEC website puts the project cost at US$195 million. It also suggests that the project is an 'upgradation of D.I.Khan - Zhob Phase I.' It is unclear whether the transaction amount is provided solely by China and in what form the fund is provided. The Pakistan Ministry of Finance Estimates of Foreign Assistance for FY 2017/18 lists this project as a 'Dualization of Yarik - Mughal Kot-Zhob Section of N-50'. It includes the Zhob Bypass.

The 110 kilometers long road project includes objectives such as the road contributing to the economic and social development of Balochistan, serving mineral rich Sandak and Rekodek areas, and linking the National Highways N-85, N-25 and Motorway M-8. However, the other two sources report the cost to be USD$80 million. It is possible that the $80m is contributed by China but this likelihood cannot be confirmed. During January 2017, it was reported that Pakistan's Under Communication Division contributed 310 million Pakistani rupee towards the 110 km section. In December 2017, the funding from China was temporarily paused. After that, no further information can be found about the relaunch of the project. CPEC website confirms the estimated cost of US$80 million. It also suggests that reports on Feasibility and PC-I have been completed and LOI forwarded to Chinese side. According to CPEC website as of Nov 2018, procedural formalities to be completed shortly. The Pakistan Ministry of Finance economic survey for 2018 reports the project is planned to be completed by 2020. A Pakistani government Finance Ministry annual project status report in May from 2017-18 does not specify the total loan commitment, but records that in May from 2017-18 China fulfilled part of the loan at the amount of 11.374 million USD, meaning the project is likely to have started or at least committed.

After that, China Road and Bridge Company submitted the engineering feasibility study report and preliminary design of the project to the Highway Bureau. Due to the large amount of project and the high total cost of the 487-kilometer Raikot-Islamabad project, China and Pakistan have decided to divide the project into three sections. The first section is Thakot-Havelian section, the second section is the Havelian to Islamabad section, and the third section is the Thakot-Raikot section. In 2016, the Pakistan-China Joint Cooperation Committee approved the repair for the section of the Thakot-Havelian of the eastern route with length of 136 kilometers. As part of CPEC, this project being developed by the Pakistani government will be financed by concessionary loans, with composite interest rates of 1.6%. The concessional loans are subsidized by the government of China, and are to be dispersed by the Exim Bank of China and the China Development Bank. China Communication Construction Co. Ltd. is the project contractor, with the executive agency being Pakistan National Highway Authority. A Pakistani Ministry of Finance annual status report 2015-16 records three loans provided by China to Pakistan for this KKH project. The first part is noted as GCL (Government Concessional Loan) with an amount of CNY 1,200.00 million (equivalent to 180.64 million USD). The second part is noted as BCL with an amount of 164.40 million USD. The last part is noted as PBC with an amount of 966.19 million USD. It is unclear what the latter two labels stand for or whether they are provided by the Chinese government. The three parts add up to USD1311 million, which is fairly close to the CPEC-reported amount of USD1366 million. This project captures the BCL component; for the other two fundings, see projects #52525 and #54424. Below are other sources that corroborate the financial details above: A Pakistani government project status report in May from 2017-18 records that China has committed only CNY1.2 billion on the project, which is significantly lower than the CPEC project total amount. During January 2017, it was reported that Pakistan's Under Communication Division contributed 600 million Pakistani rupee towards the project. According to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2016-2017, the revised budget states that 20,500 million Pakistani rupees are likely to be disbursed in 2015-2016. In the Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2017-2018, the Pakistan revised budget estimate predicts China to lend 11,137.010 million Pakistani rupees, or 82.96 million USD, to the project in 2016-2017. The budget estimate for 2017-2018 estimates China to lend 20,750 million Pakistani rupees, or 154.57 million USD, in that year. The 2016 Government of Pakistan Bond Prospectus lists the project cost as 1366 million USD, equal to the CPEC listed amount. The project is expected to be completed in 2018.

The loan has been approved, as of May 2015, according to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance. The project is to develop a city-wide train system in the eastern city of Lahore, a senior Pakistani government official announced on April 27, 2011. The governments of Pakistan and China on May 22, 2014 signed an agreement to start a metro train project in Lahore. Multiple Chinese companies will purportedly be involved with implementation. Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif and the National Development and Reform Commission China signed the agreement from Pakistan side at a ceremony which was also witnessed by President Mamnoon Hussain and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The 15-year loan will be disbursed in the next five years, and negotiations are under way to finalize other details, Khwaja Ahmed Hassan, chairman of the Lahore Transport Company (LTC), said that the bank agreed to lend the money with a two-year grace period, and he aimed to get it at 6 percent interest. He said the project was likely to begin by the end of 2011. Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, Pakistan‚Äôs most populous and prosperous province, home to more than 5 million people. Officials expect the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, will substantially decrease road traffic. The project was initially expected to start by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. The financing agreement was signed between China Exim Bank and Pakistani Economic Affairs Divison on Dec 21, 2015. The Punjab government completed its impact assessment in June 2015. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. In August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed the decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. According to the Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2015/16, the project has three components. One is a government concessional loan of CNY1,200 million, the second is a BCL of USD203.25 million, and the last one is a preferential buyer's credit of USD1235.48 million. The finalized loan terms are unclear. This project captures the Preferential buyer's credit; for the other subcomponents, see project #53820 and #54420. Below are other sources that corroborate the financial details above: A Pakistani Ministry of Finance annual status report from 2015-16 reports that loans for this project consist of three main parts, a PBC component of 1,235.48 million USD, a GCL component of 180.64 million USD, and a buyer's credit of USD 203.25 million offered by China to Pakistan. A Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2016/17 records the project with a slightly different amount. It suggests a mixed credit loan of USD USD 1626 million. This lines up well with the approximately 1.234 billion USD PBC loan. According to the report, by June 30, 2017, 672.7 million of the total amount has been disbursed. The Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2015/16 records the project with a mixed credit loan of USD1626 million and a fulfilled part of 327 million. According to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2017-2018, Pakistan included 34,534.200 million Pakistani rupees lended from China in FY 2016/17 and estimates 93,455.235 million Pakistani rupees lended from China in FY 2017/18. As of January 2017 the project completion status is: 9.2% of civil works on metro train project had been completed, including 74% Package-I (from Dera Gujjran to Chaburji), 44.25% Package-II (from Chaburji to Ali Town), 60.5% Package-III and 58% Package-IV. As of December 2017, the Orange Line Metro has entered its completions phase, however there still is much progress to be made since the Supreme Court delay sidetracked project construction. 30% of mechanical works by the projects crucial central station infrastructure have been completed by Chinese engineers. Contractors on the project have projected the completion date of Package-I to be at the end of March 2018.

An independent commercial agency, IJ Global, provides a different loan amount at 280 million USD, which has not been confirmed by any other official source. This project defers to the first amount. Unlike Phase One (see project ID #54106), EXIM Bank loaned directly to the Tajik government instead of an implementing Chinese company. There is some speculation that there was political pressure before Xi Jinping's visit to Tajikistan for the SCO Leader's summit in September 2014. The contract for Phase 2 was signed at that summit. As agreed between Tajikistan and TBEA, the Tajik government granted licenses to explore gold deposits. The government has now also agreed to give additional licenses if the profit from the gold deposits does not cover the cost of the power plant's construction. On November 10, 2015, the Dushanbe-2 combined heat and power (CHP) plant began generating electricity and heat. 252,000 tons of coal have reportedly been delivered for the plant and it is expected to provide with heat more than 242 residential and nonresidential buildings in the city. On 8 December 2016, the construction of the power plant was reported to be finished. Yue Bin, Ambassador of Tajikistan, and Rakhmon, President of Tajikistan, attended the launching ceremony. which was built by Xinjiang TBEA Ltd. using the Chinese government's concessional loans.

The loan has been approved, as of May 2015, according to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance. The project is to develop a city-wide train system in the eastern city of Lahore, a senior Pakistani government official announced on April 27, 2011. The governments of Pakistan and China on May 22, 2014 signed an agreement to start a metro train project in Lahore. Multiple Chinese companies will purportedly be involved with implementation. Chief Minister Punjab Shahbaz Sharif and the National Development and Reform Commission China signed the agreement from Pakistan side at a ceremony which was also witnessed by President Mamnoon Hussain and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The 15-year loan will be disbursed in the next five years, and negotiations are under way to finalize other details, Khwaja Ahmed Hassan, chairman of the Lahore Transport Company (LTC), said that the bank agreed to lend the money with a two-year grace period, and he aimed to get it at 6 percent interest.

The financing agreement was signed between China Exim Bank and Pakistani Economic Affairs Divison on Dec 21, 2015. The Punjab government completed its impact assessment in June 2015. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. In August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed the decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. According to the Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2015/16, the project has three components. One is a government concessional loan of CNY1,200 million, the second is a BCL of USD203.25 million, and the last one is a preferential buyer's credit of USD1235.48 million. The finalized loan terms are unclear. This project captures the USD 203.25; for the other subcomponents, see project #37280 and #54420.

A Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2016/17 records the project with a slightly different amount. It suggests a mixed credit loan of USD USD 1626 million.

Shareholders Powerchina Resources Ltd., who holds 51% shares and AMC, Qatar, who holds 49% shares, injected USD 346 million (i.e. 65.3% of total equity). The exact breakdown is unknown. For the purpose of this project, only the loan by China Eximbank is recorded. According to a February 2015 report from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the interest rate of the loan is 4.95%. For determination of the upfront tariff, the repayment period was assumed to be 10 years, and the grace period was assumed to be the same as the construction period, which is 4 years.

53584,TRUE,China,China EXIM Bank $467.8 million in preferential buyer's credits funds construction of Oil Tanker Mooring Platform and 220km pipeline system (Linked to project #38349),2017,OOF-like,"In 2017, China EXIM Bank agreed to provide preferential buyers' credit USD 467.8 million for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km of underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The project is to build a ship-to-shore crude oil pipeline. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation, will be in charge of constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong. The repayment terms of the preferential buyer's credit are unclear. In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received the technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, would review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm would submit financial offer on completion of the review. The project was expected to take 36 months, but 19 months into the project (October 2018), the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau had only completed initial surveying and some designing. This project is linked to the 82.56 million USD concessional loan from the Chinese EXIM bank in 2017 to finance this same project (project #38349).

52748,TRUE,China,China EXIM Bank loans $1.98 billion for Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant debt portion (linked to projects #56005 #38245 #56547 and #56357),2016,OOF-like,"On March 27, 2016, the Chinese EXIM Bank committed to loan 1.98 billion USD to support the construction of the ‚ÄúPayra 1320 MW Thermal Power Plant Project‚Äù. On June 9, 2014, the Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. (NWPGCL) signed a joint venture agreement with China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) to construct the first phase of the ‚ÄúPayra 1320 MW Thermal Power Plant Project‚Äù. The two companies formed the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) to carry out this project. The Prime Ministers from both countries attended the June 2014 signing ceremony for the BCPCL. NWPGCL and CMC registered BCPCL on October 1, 2014. NWPGCL is a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). BPDP and CMC are both state-owned companies. The Payra Power Plant will be constructed with 30% equity funding and 70% debt funding. Of the 30% equity, NWPGCL and CMC each will provide 50%. This project only tracks the debt funding. For the equity funding, see project #56005. An IJ Global report indicates that the Chinese EXIM Bank loaned 1.9 billion USD to Bangladesh for phase one. An April 2018 article from the Dhaka Tribune reported a quote from the BCPCL managing director valuing the Chinese EXIM Bank loans at 1.98 billion USD. Reports from Bangladeshi newspapers ‚ÄúThe Observer‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe New Nation‚Äù and from the Energy & Power Magazine state that the loan had an interest rate of 2% + LIBOR, a 4 year grace period, and a 19 year maturity. The LIBOR rate was not specified by any official sources, so this project reports a final interest rate of 3.306% at the time of commitment. The Chinese EXIM Bank committed to the loan on December 29, 2016 and 1.306% was the average 6-month LIBOR for that month. A June report on loan guarantees from the Bangladeshi Ministry of Finance states that the Bangladeshi Ministry of Finance insured the Chinese EXIM Bank funding up to 83,328,000,000 BDT on December 31, 2017. The Bangladeshi ‚ÄúStanding Committee on Non-Concessional Loans‚Äù approved this loan on September 15, 2017, at the same time they approved a 1.6 billion USD loan from the Indian Export Import Bank. Since both loans came from EXIM banks to fund power projects, and the 1.6 billion USD is close to the 1.56 billion used for the contracted consortium, some news agencies mistakenly reported this loan as 1.6 billion USD as well. The Payra Power Plant will be constructed with 30% equity funding and 70% debt funding. Of the 30% equity, NWPGCL and CMC each will provide 50%. This project only tracks the 234 million USD of funding coming from CMC. Since the total project cost is 1.56 billion USD, so the 234 million USD reflects the 15% of the funding that comes from the joint-venture equity from the CMC. The Payra power plant is located in Dhankhali, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. This places the power plant along the north side of the Payra port, which will be renovated by the China Harbour Company and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (see project #55522). Phase one will build units one and two. Each unit will have a capacity of 660 MW, so phase one has a combined capacity of 1320 MW. Prior to this project beginning, the Government of Bangladesh had to carry out a land acquisition and preparation project. The March 1, 2014 MOU between between NWPGCL and CMC also calls for a project on ‚ÄúLand Acquisition, Land Development & Protection‚Äù for the Payra 1320 MW Power Plant project. This subproject has an estimated total cost of 7,826,300,000 BDT. The Government of Bangladesh provided 7,727,700,000 of the funding, while the NWPGCL provided the remaining 98,700,000 BDT. That project had completed 98% of physical progress and 92% of financial progress as of June 2018, and is presumed to be complete, since construction on the power plant itself has now begun. In December 2017, BPDB contracted China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (NPEC) and China National Energy Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (CECC) to construct the power plants. These firms agreed to a 1.56 billion USD deal. According to a NWPGCL April 2019 update, all of unit 1 had been installed and installation of unit 2 was underway. Construction of the coal jetty, the coal unloader, and the water intake system are complete. The coal conveyer gallery and steel structure were still under construction. According to the NWPGCL 2018 annual report, unit 1 will become operational in August 2019 with unit 2 becoming operational in December 2020. A consortium led by the China Datang Overseas Electric Technology and O&M Co. Ltd. will carry out operations and maintenance of this project. 77% of the physical progress is complete. NWPGCL reported ‚ÄúFinancial Progress‚Äù at 57.48%, which possibly reflects the amount of disbursed funds, but the definition of ‚Äúfinancial progress‚Äù is unclear. Once operational, this power plant will sell energy to the BPDB at a cost of 6.56 BDT per unit of energy. NWPGCL has submitted a Coal Supply Agreement (CSA) and a Coal Transportation Agreement (CTA) to operate using imported coal. China has highlighted the fact that this is the so-called ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù, so this project is also referred to as the 'Bangladesh's first eco-friendly power plant'. Other names for this power plant include 'Payra Power Hub' and the alternative spellings of ‚ÄúPyra‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaira‚Äù. There are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially from a joint venture between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially from Chinese EXIM Bank Funding. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project containing two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners clarified that these plants are near each other, but distinct plants within the region-wide electrification campaign. These projects include: Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (phase 2) (BCPCL): Bangladesh‚Äôs Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China‚Äôs China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) Joint Venture in October 2014. The joint venture is captured in project #56005. The Chinese EXIM Bank funding for phase one (units 1 and 2) is captured in project #52748. The Chinese EXIM Bank funding for phase two (units 3 and 4) is unspecified, with the most recent details reported in project #38245 Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Coal-Fired Power Plant (Ashuganj/ APSCL): Bangladesh‚Äôs Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) and China‚Äôs China Energy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CEEC) established a joint venture in July 2017 to build a power plant in Patuakhali. The joint venture is captured in project #56547. CEEC will solicit a loan from the Chinese EXIM Bank for the debt portion of the project. The Chinese EXIM Bank funding is currently uncaptured. Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) MW Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant (RPCL): Bangladesh‚Äôs Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and China‚Äôs NORINCO established a joint venture in November 2017. The joint venture is captured in project #56357. The Chinese EXIM Bank funding is currently uncaptured. This project should not be confused with any of the joint-development agreements for the Payra 3600 MW LNG-to-Power Project signed between NWPGCL and Siemens (Germany). STAFF_NOTE: Despite the news articles which reported the loan terms and the Bangladeshi Government refer to this loan as non-concessional, the grant element is 43.52%, so this project codes it as concessional. This project is coded as mixed intent, because the power plant also has equity financing (described in project #56005).",230,Energy Generation and Supply,NEW INFRA,Implementation,Mixed (Some Development),Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Bangladesh,Bangladesh,1898332244,FALSE,FALSE,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ANNT000020170302ec9q009nb&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=HTEGBG0020160929ec9q00003&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vults7c3kv89j45/BU_PITCH_ENGLISH_2018.xlsx?dl=0, Academic Journal Article; http://bd.china-embassy.org/eng/dshd/t1352213.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://mof.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/mof.portal.gov.bd/page/e9e8a8c8_8a8b_4536_a18b_fc5ca696650a/St_6a1_en.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2018/04/17/china-funding-payra-power-plant, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eximbank.gov.cn/info/news/201806/t20180610_2536.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Payra_power_station, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://www.dropbox.com/s/czloq0owzge5og0/IJGlobal%20-%20Payra%20Coal-Fired%20Power%20Plant%20%281320MW%29%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/144175, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eximbank.gov.cn/tm/Newdetails/index.aspx?nodeid=343&page=ContentPage&categoryid=0&contentid=29406 , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Payra_power_station#cite_note-reu-6, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-12/26/c_136852389.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eximbank.gov.cn/aboutExim/annals/2016/201807/P020180712402151419837.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://thedailynewnation.com/print-a-news/108634/-35b-credit-for-rampal-payra-plants.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=52390, Media Report, including Wikileaks",16,"China Export-Import Bank, State-Owned Company","China National Machinery and Equipment Import & Export Corporation, State-Owned Company; North-West Power Generation Company Limited (NWPGCL), State-Owned Company; Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), Government Agency; China Datang Corporation (CDT), State-Owned Company","North-West Power Generation Company Limited (NWPGCL), State-Owned Company; Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), Government Agency; Ministry of Finance, Government Agency",3,1980000000,USD,1.043020792,1,1980000000,,,,,1,771,666,Bangladesh,BGD,BD,50,513,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,Concessional,3.306,19,4,43.52,Payra,

It is planned that the complex will cover the entire value chain, from ore extraction to the production of high-quality steel grades. C1 and C2 reserves at the Massalskoe deposit amount to 729 million tonnes. In addition, Massalsky Mining and Processing Plant LLP and Exim Bank of China signed a framework agreement to finance the project, which cost 1.3 billion USD. In 2017, a feasibility study was performed on the construction site and was approved by Tau-Ken Samruk analysts. As of 2018, the funds from the Chinese EXIM bank are yet to be sent, and Tau-Ken Samruk describes the site as under design development, with an estimated completion year of 2025. Mazhit Turmagambetov, CEO of Tau-Ken Samruk JSC, commented during the signing ceremony: 'We want to produce our own high-quality steel, as currently Kazakhstan only imports the metal, bringing in around 1.5 million tonnes of steel annually. Our plant is not large by international standards, with an annual capacity of 940,000 tonnes. This is a new industry trend, because enterprises increasingly need to be flexible. They have to be ready to adapt at any moment and produce what is required by industry customers at any given time.'

The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) claims that it is the largest hydropower project undertaken by WAPDA since the completion of Mangla, Tarbela and Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Projects. The Project is designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri 41 Km North East of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse is being constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 Km South of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 Km South of ChatterKalas.The Project will produce 5.15 Billion units of electricity annually. Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company Limited was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. On 7 July 2007, the Chinese consortium CGGC-CMEC (Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation) were awarded the contract to construct the dam and power station. The construction contract was settled at a cost of PKR 90.90 billion by the end of the year and in January 2008, the letter of commencement was issued. According to WAPDA, as of March 2018, 90%of the construction works have already been completed. According to a March 2018 Tariff Petition document issued by Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company Limited to Pakistan National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of PKR 506,579 million is estimated to be funded based on a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total debt component amounts to PKR 401,416 million, which is around 3823 USD million. According to the document, the debt portion consists of Foreign Relent Loans from GoP, cash development loans and local commercial financing. Foreign Relent Loans are raised by the Government of Pakistan and relent to NJHPC at a fixed rate set by Economic Affairs Division of Pakistan. Foreign Relent Loans received by NJHPC consist of Islamic Development Bank Loans IDB Istisna I &II of US$ 358 Million, China Exim Bank Loan I and II of US$ 1024 Million, Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development KFD loan I and II of US$ 74 Million, Saudi Fund for Development SFD Loan I and II of US$ 181 Million and OPEC Fund for International Development OFID Loan I and II of US$ 81 Million. The China Eximbank Loans are broken up into China Eximbank Loan 1 of 448 USD million and China Eximbank Loan 2 of 576 USD million. Both have a repayment period of 20 years and a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + 280 bps. As the relevant LIBOR interest rate was not explicitly identified in the document, the LIBOR rate at the time the project agreement was finalized or published would be used. As such, the 6 month LIBOR rate in March 2018 (2.32%) was used for the purpose of this project record. A interest rate of 5.12% is thus recorded.

The loan has a 2% interest rate, 5 year grace period, and 20 year maturity. According to the 2016 ODA Report from the Economic Relations Division of the Bangladeshi Government, none of the pledged funds have been dispersed as of 2017. On August 19, 2018, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Zuo visited the project site for the stone laying ceremony, implying the project is now under construction. In November 2014, China Electric Power Construction Group and Bangladesh Dhaka Water Supply and Drainage Board signed a sewage treatment project agreement named the Dasher Kandi Sewage Treatment Plant Project [ËææËàçÂ∞îÁîòÂú∞Ê±°Ê∞¥Â§ÑÁêÜÈ°πÁõÆ]. The project is located on 60 acres of land in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and construction includes sewage treatment plants, pumping stations and a sewage pipe network with a sewage treatment capacity of 500,000m3/day. After the project is completed, CEPCC will be responsible for operation and maintenance for one year. The project was previously scheduled to begin in January 2011 and end in December 2013, but the project could not launch due to insufficient funding. Bangladesh's Economic Relations Division's 2016-2017 Annual Report Indicates that the Chinese EXIM Loan agreement was signed on October 14, 2016. Since this project tracks the funding from the Chinese EXIM Bank, the commitment year corresponds with the October 2016 signing. For the umbrella project of Chinese loans to Bangladesh on November 14, 2016, see project #52873. The other two sub-projects are #34433 and #38342.

STAFF_NOTE: The sources from China typically spell this project as 'Dasher Kandhi' or 'Dasher Gandhi', while most of the sources from Bangladesh spell the project as 'Dasherkanhi'. It is possible that this project is an Export Credit deal instead of a loan, since some of the funding immediately went back to a Chinese contractor. However, it is unclear if all the funding went back to the CEPCC or if only a portion did.

40362,TRUE,China,China loan syndicate funds Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline (Additional Financing) (link to #39562),2015,OOF-like,"The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1454 Kilometers long gas pipeline that will run through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. Construction of the pipeline was split into two stages. The first stage of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline, which comprises all sections of the Bozoi-Shymkent part, was completed in 2015, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 6 bcm per year. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. In December 2016, a second stage of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline project, comprising a linear part of the pipeline with a total length of 311.0 km, was completed. In November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, which increased the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. ICA has announced that, by the end of 2019, it expects the construction of repair and maintenance sites, shift camps and the Beineu gas measuring station, as well as the telecommunications and the highway system will be completed. This project records additional financing from China Development Bank and Bank of China in the form of a 350 Million USD loan each. The additional financing will go to Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline. The financing represents a 700 Million USD upsizing of the existing 1.8 Billion USD loan recorded in project #39562. According to IJGlobal, the financial closure date for this additional financing was 17th September 2015, and as such the commitment year has been assumed to be 2015. Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP, a joint venture between JSC KazTransGas and China National Petroleum Corporation (each with 50% interest) was established on January 18, 2011 to construct and operate the gas pipeline. KTG is a transportation company, which owns a 100% interest in several domestic regional gas distribution companies and a 100% interest in ICA, which in turn operates the largest natural gas pipeline network in Kazakhstan. In December 2012, the joint venture entered into a $1.8 billion syndicated loan facility which was led by China Development Bank. The loan was to finance the development, construction and operation of the Bozoi-Shymkent part of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline. In February 2016, certain amendments to this facility were signed. Amounts due under this loan facility bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.7% per annum for the duration of the guarantee period and, thereafter, at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.2% per annum. The loan matures on 11 March 2028. The loan is secured by corporate guarantees from the Company and CNPC. As at 31 December 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion (KZT 341 billion). Construction of the Bozoi-Shymkent part started in September 2011. The construction of the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent pipeline was first confirmed under the 'Agreement on cooperation in the construction and operation of the Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline', signed between the Governments of the Afghanistan and China on August 18, 2007. The agreement was then later amended on October 14, 2009. The Agreement on the Main Principles of Construction and Operation of the Kazakhstan-Chinese Gas Pipeline (AMP) was signed within the frame of the official visit of President Hu Jintao to Kazakhstan on June 12, 2010. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas deliveries to China pursuant to a contract concluded between KTG and PetroChina for the supply of 5 bcm of natural gas during the period from 15 October 2017 until 14 October 2018. The total estimated consideration under this agreement is U.S.$889.7 million. The price of gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement is linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. Negotiations are ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between KTG and PetroChina. BSGP and the Company expect the transportation of gas to China to increase in the coming years and, in order to facilitate such transportation, plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 (at an estimated cost of KZT 109.2 billion). See ‚ÄúManagement‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Performance‚ÄîCapital Expenditures‚Äù.

In October 2009, the PPIB approved the Feasibility Study Report of the project and in November 2013, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority granted KPCL a generation license to develop a 720 MW hydro-based generation facility at Karot village, District Rawalpindi, in Punjab province. The project is located on Jhelum River, near Karot Bridge. It is the 4th among 5 Cascade HPPs to be developed along Jhelum River. KPCL is 93% owned by China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation, and 7% owned by Pakistan's Associated Technologies. KPCL completed a EPC Tender evaluation on January 9th 2015, and awarded the EPC contract to Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation Consortium. The project will be undertaken on a build-own-operate-transfer basis. Construction began in 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2021. The project is designated a priority project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and a flagship project under Belt and Road Initiative. Project is part of the $2 billion Karot power projects, focusing on hydro and wind power, under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor reported to be completed by 2018. The project will feature a single power generation complex with an installed capacity will be 720-megawatts with four units of 180-megawatts each. The power structure layout will include a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project itself is denominated as 80% in Punjab (powerhouse) and 20% in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (reservoirs). According to an interview with the chief accountant from China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, the total cost of the project is 1.75 billion USD, with a debt-equity ratio of 80:20. The project achieved financial closure on February 22, 2017. According to IJGlobal, the 80% debt component was financed by loans from China Development Bank, China Exim Bank, China Silk Road Fund and International Finance Corporation (IFC), each one worth 315 Million USD, along with an additional 100 Million USD loan from IFC. This project records the loans from the Chinese banks. For the equity component, China Three Gorges Corporation invested 316.20 Million USD, while Associated technologies invested 23.90 Million USD. The IMF puts the loan interest rate at 5.11%, with a maturity period of 12 years and a grace period of 5 years. It was additionally reported that there is a 30-year concession period. On April 20 2015, China's $40 Billion Silk Road Fund signed a memorandum of understanding with China Three Gorges Corporation and the PPIB on the development of Pakistan's hydropower project, pledging to finance the project through equity investment in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, and participating in a loan syndicate made up of Chinese banks. As of 2017, the Silk Road Fund has disbursed 1.65 Billion USD. The Silk Road Fund also owns 15% of China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Company as of 2017. On March 14 2017, IFC announced that it will invest $100 million in the Karot Hydropower Project, and reported that it acquired a 15% stake in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited in 2015. IFC stated that this investment is its first major collaboration with the China Export Import Bank, China Development Bank, and Silk Road Fund. The first unit is projected to begin power generation in 2020, coming online prior to its deadline.

The Project was initially being developed by the Pakistan Water & Power Development Authority (the ‚ÄúWAPDA‚Äù), and was offered to Chinese investors/companies during President of Pakistan‚Äôs visit to China in October 2008, and an MOU was signed between China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) and GoP in 2008. Kohala Hydro Company Limited, an ultimate subsidiary of CTG was issued a Letter of Intent in January 2009, and was tasked to set up the project under BOOT basis. In August 2014 the Project was included in the ‚ÄúActively Promoted Project‚Äù in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and is the only CPEC project in AJK. The Project is being developed downstream of Chakothi-Hattian Hydropower Project and upstream of the Mahl Hydropower Project. It will consist of a Dam on River Jhelum, with twin 17.4 km long headrace tunnels which will end in the power house downstream on the River Jhelum. The curved concrete gravity dam with a crest elevation of 910 m, will have a maximum height of 69 m and a top length of 270 m. The main power station will be equipped with 4 vertical Francis turbine generator units, each with a capacity of 275 MW. An additional 24 MW will run on the ecological flow of the River downstream of the Dam. The dam site is Siran Village, and the power plant is located in Barsala in District Muzafarabad. A consortium of Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co. Ltd, & China Three Gorges Project Development Co. Ltd have been selected as the EPC Contractor (the ‚ÄúEPC Contractor‚Äù), with EPC Contract value of USD 1,793 million. Due to the complexities involved, construction period will be 6.5 years as approved by Panel of Experts. The hydropower project has a total project cost of 2760.17 million USD, and will be financed with a debt-equity structure of 70:30. In 2014, the Kohala hydro power project was listed as part of the China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor initiative. As of June 23, 2017, a document from NEPRA confirmed that a foreign loan syndicate led by China Development Bank will be contributing a loan amounting to $1642.30 USD million.

By May 2014, the consortium of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co., Ltd., its subsidiary in Hong Kong, and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd., officially obtained the right of development of Sahiwal 2x660MW coal-fired power project, located in Qadirabad, Sahiwal, Punjab. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30 2014, with Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan and Shahbaz Sharif, Chief Minister of Punjab Province attending the event. Coal was procured from Indonesia and South Africa for the project. The project spans 690 hectares, which was given by the Pakistani government free of charge. According to CPEC website, the project achieved Commercial Operation Date (COD) on Oct 28, 2017, and has been connected to the national grid. According to a March 2015 document from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) as well as an announcement from ICBC, the total investment is estimated to be 1.808 billion USD. The project's debt-equity ratio is 80:20. The debt component is covered by a Chinese loan syndicate led by ICBC. In February 2015, ICBC had submitted a letter of interest to act as financial advisor and arranger for the borrower. On April 20, 2015, ICBC Chairman Jiang Jianqing signed power project financing agreements for four energy power projects in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistani Prime Minister Sharif. The four energy power projects include Sukhi Kinari hydropower project, Dawood wind power project, Sahiwal coal-fired power plant, and Thar coal-power integrated project. Sinosure reported in 2018 that that the loan syndicate had in fact covered up to 85% of the total cost, providing 1.8 billion USD worth of export buyer credits. According to the ICBC website, ICBC alone provided 1.44 billion USD worth of export buyer credit. Other Chinese banks in the syndicate include Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China. Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co., Ltd and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd provided the equity funding. Sinosure has earlier committed to reduce the premium rate from 9% to 7%, increasing the business insurance coverage for overseas projects from 50% to 65%. For the purpose of this project, only the funding from ICBC has been recorded. For details on the equity portion, please see the linked project #54134. According to a March 2015 NEPRA document, the interest rate of the loan is 4.95%. For determination of the upfront tariff, the repayment period was assumed to be 10 years, and the grace period was assumed to be the same as the construction period, which is 4 years. This project has thus recorded the loan details as such. Project's first 660-MW capacity plant unit was reported a success with completion in a short 22 months and inaugurated May 2017 by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and has been linked to the national grid.

Construction will be carried out by Sinohydro Corporation of China. Work began on June 28th, 2012, and the project was completed on June 28th, 2017. The total estimated cost of the project was US$252.3 million according to the Government of Sri Lanka 2017 Bond Prospectus, but it is unclear what organization provided the remaining funding. No other external donors for this project are listed in Sri Lanka Government documents, so it seems any additional funding would have been provided by Sri Lanka. This USD 214.2 million loan from CDB has a variable interest rate of LIBOR 06 Months for US$ + 2.90% margin, a grace period of 4 years, and a 15 year maturity (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2012 & 2017 Annual Performance Reports). The interest rate is coded based on the 6 Month LIBOR at time of signing of the agreement. The average 6 Month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. Total interest rate is therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%. The objective of the project was to provide irrigation facilities for 82,000 ha, increase the cropping intensity up to 1.81, a d issue 90 MCM of water for domestic/industrial purposes and construction of 25 MW hydro power plants. To do this, a main dam (61 m high and 465m long) was constructed. Sinohydro Corporation of China has undertaken the construction work of Moragahakanda reservoir Main Dam and Saddle Dam 1 (with a height of 50.5m and length of 365m) including 25MW Hydro Power generating unit. The Saddle Dam 2 (with a height of 21.5m and length of 275m) of the reservoir was completed using local funds. The saddle dams retain 570 MCM of water. The contractor has completed preliminary works such as contactor‚Äôs office complex, workshop, Baylay Bridge over Amban Ganga, concrete batching plant, quarry production plant and necessary equipment and machines. The Moragahakanda reservoir was estimated to hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 ha.

The goal of this project is to provide safe drinking water via pipes to all 45 Grama Niladdhari divisions in Katana Divisional Seretariat covering 50% of the population in the area (similar to project #53566). To do this, the project will, over 3 years, construct a water intake structure with a capacity of 42,000 m3/day, a water treatment plant of 18,000m3/day, a ground reservoir of 1,500 m3 capacity, a raw water and treated water transmission mains totaling up to an approximate length of 50 Km, elevated towers of 1,500 m3 capacity, a distribution network of 135 KM, and facilities to operate and maintain the water supply scheme. The project is expected to commence operations in 2021 and is in the tender evaluation stage as of March 2018. The project is being implemented by the Sri Lanka National Water Supply & Drainage Board. According to a March 2018 Sri Lanka news source, the Sri Lanka National Water Supply & Drainage Board Assistant General Manager for the North Central Province Sudath Ratnayake indicated that the Chinese loan for this project carries an interest rate of 1-1.5 per cent plus London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and is payable over 15 years. The interest rate is coded based on the 6 Month LIBOR at time of signing of the agreement. The average 6 month LIBOR (USD) for August 2017 was 1.454%. The least concessional base interest rate from the 1-1.5 per cent range will be used for calculating the total interest rate. The total interest rate is therefore coded as 1.5% + 1.454%, or 2.954%. The total project is expected to cost US$120.5 million; the remaining $18 million will be provided by the Bank of Ceylon (state-owned, commercial, Sri Lankan bank).

40305,TRUE,China,China Eximbank reschedules Kyrgyz Paper Mill debt ,2003,ODA-like,"According to various media reports, in 2003, China Eximbank signed an agreement with the Kyrgyz Finance Ministry that allows for the restructuring of debt worth 100 million yuan. The 100 million RMB was reportedly the total value of interest-free and concessional loans given by the bank to the Kyrgyz government for the construction of a paper mill. According to the Kyrgyzstan AMP, there were two credits extended by China for the construction of the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Mill in Tokmok, which is located in the Chuy valley. The first credit was extended in 1996 (AMP ID 87188512380) and the second was extended in 1998 (AMP ID 87188512381). The debt has been restructured in pursuance of the resolution of the Paris Club of creditors on the consolidation of the Kyrgyz Republic's debt. In accordance with the agreement, the debt to be serviced (interest, plus the principal sum) is to be restructured. Media reported that the sum of payments deferred between 2001 and 2004 will total 1.98m yuan (about 250,000 dollars), which is to be paid within 10 years, starting from 2007. However, the value of 100 million yuan has been recorded as the restructured debt amount, because a MOFCOM source in 2015 reported that as of 2015, Kyrgyzstan still owes China 9,800,000 USD (around 40 million RMB in 2003) for the paper mill loans, and that in 2014 Kyrgyzstan had negotiated the return of 60,200,000 RMB to China by 2017. The sum of both values is close to the 100 million RMB that was reportedly loaned to Kyrgyzstan, suggesting that that was the total amount of debt that had been rescheduled in 2003. . It should also be noted that COMPLANT, the Chinese contractor for the paper mill project, reported a total project cost of 129,016,065 RMB, and People Daily report in 2002 put the total Chinese loan amount at 150,000,000 RMB.

The project assistance will be in form of a grant. Concrete matters regarding implementation of this project would be stipulated in a separate contract to be signed between the agencies to be designated by the two governments. A 2013 resource states that the project to install new broadband seismic stations equipped with advance technology that was initiated following the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake to strengthen seismic monitoring system, has completed.

Construction did not begin until 2012 due to funding negotiations, with the plant being downsized to a 100 MW capacity. It was agreed that TBEA would front the construction costs of $178 million by borrowing from China EXIM Bank, and Tajikistan in return would grant TBEA rights to explore and develop gold deposits in the Eastern Duoba and Upper Kumarg mines. Tajikistan aimed to borrow money through concessional loans through EXIM Bank themselves, but Tajik Minister of Energy and Water Resources, Usmonali Usmonov stated: 'It has practically been impossible to attract funds from international financial institutions for construction of the Dushanbe-2 CHP plant‚Ä¶..When the project is not designed for the year-round operation, it cannot be efficient, and therefore, nobody wants to finance such projects.‚Äù The power plant, Dushanbe 2, is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) which will provide heat and electricity to Dushanbe, and will only operate in the winter. There were two distinct phases. Phase 1 installed a capacity of 100 MW, and Phase 2 installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. Phase 1 was completed in 2014. The project is paid back by the Tajik Government on a model of 'resource for energy,' meaning that along with the power plant contract, a nearby goldmine is also awarded to the Chinese side, and the gains from the mining company's gold mining would be used to offset the construction cost of the power station of 178 million US dollars (equivalent to about 1.12 billion yuan), and the net profit can be 1.464 billion yuan.
