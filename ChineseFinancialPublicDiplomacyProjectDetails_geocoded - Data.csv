32016,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2000,China,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",,Low-interest loan from Chinese bank to finance plywood factory in Cambodia (Linked to Project ID#32071),"On July 26, 2000, Keat Chhon, state minister and minister of economy and finance, and Yang Zilin, president of the Chinese Export-Import Bank signed an agreement under which the China Export-Import Bank agreed to provide the Cambodian government with a low-interest loan of 99.6 million CNY or about US$11.85m dollars to build a plywood factory. The loan with an annual 3 per cent interest rate is to be repaid in 12 years, including a four-year grace period. The Cambodian government would lend this money to a Chinese-Cambodian joint venture, Kampuchea-Chinese International Cooperation Co Ltd, which is behind the project to build a factory producing plywood from rubber trees and scraps in Chup and Memot plantations, Kompong Cham Province (See Project ID#32071 for the follow-up of this agreement) STAFF_NOTE: Unsure regarding the kind of product that will be produced by the factory. While the Cambodian newspaper `Reaksmei Kampuchea' reported that the factory will produce plywood , Xinhua News Agency reported that the factory will produce Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) (recorded in Project ID#32071). Although both plywood and MDF are made of the same material (rubber wood), they are of different density, hence different kind of material. It may be a reporting error on the part of either one of the publisher or the factory would be producing both plywood and MDF. Despite this issue, I am confident that this project (ID#32016) and Project ID#32071 are referring to the same event. As such, the transaction amount has been temporarily removed from this project to prevent potential double-counting of Chinese financing.

The loan agreement was signed between Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Ning Fukui and the Cambodian government on November 27, 2003 in Phnom Penh. The interest-free loan agreement was one of two agreements signed during the ceremony; under the other agreement, China would provide a grant of US$6.1 million dollar to Cambodia, which would then be handed over to the Cambodian Foreign Ministry for general use by the Cambodian government (See Project ID#32081). The rebuilding project was undertaken by Shanghai Construction Group General Co. The project began on October 2004 and was completed on 31 Dec 2007. An Inauguration for the opening of the road was held on April 29, 2008. The interest-free loan is not the only recorded financial assistance provided by the Chinese government the project. In November 2002, China had provided a concessional loan with a 2% interest rate of US$60,980,000. On the same date, China had also provided US$2,430,000 in grant for the project (based on the 2 CDC reports found in the resource section below). The CDC reports are supported by a speech made by Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen, during his visit to the construction sites of National Road 7 in 26 July 2006; the PM has mentioned three types of assistance by China for the project- grant, non-interest loan and low-interest loan. It is difficult to tell if the US$24 million interest-free loan was provided by the Chinese government in addition to the US$60.98 million loan and US$2.43 million grant, or if the Chinese government has converted US$24 million out of the US$60.98 concessional loan into an interest-free loan. However, the 2009 'Overview on Transport Infrastructure Sectors in the Kingdom of Cambodia' report published by the Infrastructure and Regional Integration Technical Working Group (IRITWG) has recorded that the total cost of the rehabilitation project for National Road 7 is around US$62.8 million dollars and was financed by China, so the latter scenario is more likely. STAFF_NOTE: A document from the Cambodian Ministry of Transport stated in 2015 that the money for the renovations of road 7 was not separate from the money used to construct national roads 71 and 72. The document cited $112 million USD as the total transaction amount, but did not break the costs down further about how much went to road 7 specifically.

On Poan Monirath and the Chairman of EXIM Bank of China, Mr Li Ruogu, signed a Preferential Buyer's Credit Loan Agreement. Under the agreement, EXIM bank agrees to provide a concessional loan of US$31,014,469 for an irrigation project in Kampong Trabek, Prey Veng Province. The loan agreement for the project is one out of 14 agreements signed between China and Cambodia on 21 December 2009; the total value of the agreements was widely believed to be US$853 million (See Project ID#32201). While the development of an irrigation system is one of the objective, the project is more known to be a flood control project in response to Kampong Trabek being susceptible to flood damage. Based on a report by Mekong River Commission (MRC), the flood risk has been estimated at US$0.7 million per year. The goal of the project is to improve flood control standard and to upgrade land utilization rate, cultivation condition and grain output and to build flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Tra Beak river together with field irrigation and drainage system so as to provide irrigation water source and ensure drainage capability. Based on the CDC report, the project will include the building of flood control dyke on both banks of Preaek Trabek river (aka Kampong Trabek River or Stung Trabek) together with an irrigation canal and drainage canal network so as to provide irrigation water source for crops and ensure drainage capability to prevent flood damage. This corroborates with the MRC report, which has mentioned similar flood control mechanism with much more details and has reported that once the proposed flood control mechanism have been installed, the villagers can expect about 5 crops per year and net benefits from paddy of US$3.45 million/year According to Mekong Institute, the project was completed on March 24, 2014. The project was handed over to Cambodia in April 2015. The loan details are unknown.

The average 6 Month LIBOR rate in September 2010 was 0.478%. Total interest rate is therefore coded as 0.478% + 2.40%, or 2.878%. According to the Sri Lanka Department of External Resources, this project was completed on 9 September 2013. On 6 December 2009, The Sunday Times of Sri Lanka reported that the contract to rehabilitate (widen and improve) all adjunct roads in the North of Sri Lanka had been given to four different Chinese companies in 13 different packages. The four Chinese companies, China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC), China Harbour, China Railway No 5 Engineering Group Co. Ltd. and Synohydro Corporation will share the deals between them. Based on Sri Lanka's Department of External Resources (ERD) the project has 7 packages, which corroborated with the 'Development Performance Year End Review 2014' report by Sri Lanka's Ministry of Finance and Planning and the summary report by Ministry of Highways, Higher Education and Investment Promotion. The 7 contract packages are: 1) C1A - 63 km of Kandy- Jaffna road (From Galkulama to 230th km). Contractor: CATIC 2) C1B- 90 km of Kandy- Jaffna road (From 230th km to Jaffna).

The project was jointly funded by the Exim Bank of China & the Government of Sri Lanka. The Project was valued at Rs. 3,662 Million. Construction began on Feb 11, 2011 and was completed on Oct 13, 2013. One source stated that the projects would be executed under 5 civil works contracts, and that 5 loans were signed by Exim bank on 09.09.2010 to satisfy these contracts. This was the only source to break down the projects in this way.

According to the 2017 Sri Lanka Government Bond Prospectus, the estimated total cost of the project was 357.69 million USD. The Government of Sri Lanka would provide the remaining funds for the project. The 300 million USD CDB loan has an interest rate of LIBOR 06 Months for US$ + 2.95% margin and a repayment period of 15 years including a 3 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2014 Annual Performance Report). The interest rate is coded based on the 6 Month LIBOR at time of signing of the agreement. The average 6 Month LIBOR rate in March 2014 was 0.331%. Total interest rate is therefore coded as 0.331% + 2.95%, or 3.281%. This project commenced on 11 March 2014 and was completed on 11 March 2019 (see 'Resource Mobilization' from Sri Lanka Department of External Resources). The objective of this project was to rehabilitate and improve 270 km of priority road sections to ensure the connectivity among already improved road sections. Areas of the project include: Southern, Eastern, Uva, Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces. The Sri Lanka Department of External Resources divides Priority Road Project 3 (PRP3) Phase I into two parts, A and B. The contractors for PRP3-Phase I (A) were China National Aero-Technology International Engineering (CATIC - ENG) and Xi'an Dagang Machinery Co. Ltd., although it is unclear which specific roads each company worked on. The contractors for PRP3-Phase I (B) were CATIC and Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation (Hunan), and the specific contractor for each road is listed in the relevant section below. Under PRP3- Phase I (A) the following 6 roads were rehabilitated (see Ministry of Highways and Investment 'Ongoing Projects'): 1. Ratnapura - Palawela - Karawita Road: 00.00km - 21.28 km 2. Veyangoda -Ruwanwella Road: 12.4 km - 32.2 km (19.8 km total length). This section also included the rehabilitation of a bridge. 3. Meegahajandura-Kumaragama Road: 0.00 km - 8.8 km 4.

On 16 September 2014, China Communications Construction (CCC) signed the Colombo Port City Franchise Agreement with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, outlining an investment for the Colombo Port City Project (now known as the Colombo International Financial City). On this same day, China Development Bank signed an 805 million USD commercial loan financing agreement with CCC for this project (see attached 2014 article CDB). The equity investment from CCC for the Colombo Port City Project is captured in this project. For details regarding the 805 million USD loan from China Development Bank, see linked project ID #33431.

The Colombo Port City (CPC) Project was initially conceived as a public sector project that would be undertaken by the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA). Consequently, the SLPA commissioned at its own cost an “initial technical feasibility study” in April 2010 for the reclamation of land south of the new breakwater. Around June 2010, an environmental impact assessment study was commissioned by SLPA also at its own cost through the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for a reclamation area of 200 hectares. 

In October 2010, Sri Lanks’s Urban Development Authority (UDA) completed a master plan study based on the initial technical feasibility study and submitted a project proposal to the SLPA for consideration. In April 2011, based on an unsolicited concept proposal submitted by China Communications & Construction Company (CCCC), the parent company of CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd., the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) decided to not to commit public funds to construct the CPC Project and proceeded to negotiate with CCCC to implement the project entirely as a foreign direct investment, with no financial guarantees by the GOSL on the investment.  

After a 2.5 year period of negotiation with a Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) and a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) represented by 16 GOSL organizations, a project agreement was entered into between CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd., and the Secretary to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping (acting for and on behalf of the GOSL) on September 16, 2014. CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd., is a project company (special purpose vehicle) and wholly owned subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which operates under its parent company China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC). 

The project agreement was signed, and the project’s construction works were ceremonially inaugurated on the same day (September 16, 2014) in the presence of the President of the Peoples’ Republic of China and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, during the Chinese President’s State visit to Sri Lanka.  Colombo Port City (CPC) Project is being implemented on public-private partnership (PPP) project and BOOT basis and it is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. 

The $1.396 billion project is divided into two phases: the first phase investment will cost $1.150 billion and the second phase investment will cost $246 million. The first phase was started on September 16, 2014. Its originally planned completion date was April 2020, but construction was suspended due to the change of government in March 2015. Construction then resumed in August 2016. The new expected completion date is April 2024.  

On May 12, 2017, China Development Bank provided a $805 million loan to CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. for the first phase of the project, or roughly 70% of the total cost of the first phase project of the project.  The loan carries a 10-year maturity and a 3-year grace period. No sovereign guarantee was provided for the loan. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. 

STAFF_NOTE: This project is also known as the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) project. The Chinese project title is 斯里兰卡科伦坡港口城项目. The second phase of the project is also expected to be financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. This project is located on reclaimed land adjacent to the Galle Face Green in the city of Colombo. It is between the southern edge of the new Colombo South Port and the Fort Lighthouse. Its locational coordinates are 06°56′00″N 79°50′00″E.",Implementation,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),OOF-like,Commercial,430,Other Multisector,"http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2019-01/16/c_1124000017.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

The start of works on the section of the proposed corridor going through China was announced earlier in 2016. The Lao P.D.R. section project has been estimated at US$6.7 billion, out of which 30 percent will be provided by a joint venture company already formed between Lao P.D.R. and China. Lao P.D.R. will need to contribute with 30 percent in the capital of this company (or around US$700 million) in annual installments over the medium term. Out of this, US$480 million will be borrowed from China while the remaining funds will be provided by the Budget. The joint venture company will need to secure the remaining 70 percent of the project costs. Lao P.D.R. Ministry of Finance has noted that no sovereign guarantee will be provided. The grace period is 5 years with a 20 year loan with 2% interest. The formal start of works was announced in December 2015. However, progress has been slow due to still unresolved property issues as well as detailed design works. More recently, six lots for construction works (covering the full length of the proposed railway) were tendered with the awards being given to two Chinese companies with considerable experience in the field.

The government of Nepal has assigned the Inter-modal Transport Development Board to facilitate all the construction work which will be done by China’s Beijing Real Estate Group Company. Under the project, a border inspection building, cargo warehouse, litigation-warehouse, a parking lot with a capacity of accommodating at least 158 big containers and 33 cars and a 112-meter-long bridge over the Bhotekoshi River will be constructed. China had also agreed to upgrade a 6.5 km road connecting the dry port to the border with China. Construction began in December 2012 and was expected to be completed within 2 and a half years. The construction project is expected to ease the bottleneck for surging trade between China and Nepal. 

As of November 2014, the completion of the dry port will be delayed as a result of transportation problems created by a landslide in Jure, Sindhupalchok, and the sweeping away of the Bhotekoshi bridge by floods. The bridge was crucial to transporting construction materials to the dry port. The government has also failed to clear houses along the road connecting Miteri Bridge and the dry port. The road expansion and construction of a bridge over Bhotekoshi are included in the dry port contract. At this point only 60-65 percent of the construction work has been completed.

Phase-1 (captured by project ID #34509): On March 3, 2004, at the Chinese Embassy in Kabul, Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi and Afghan Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment Minister Mohammad Yusuf Nooristani signed a grant agreement for Phase I of the Parwan Water Conservancy Restoration Project. The purpose of this project was to rehabilitate an irrigation canal in Parwan Province, which is one of the most agriculturally productive areas of Afghanistan. 

Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Co., Ltd. (JWHC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The design of the project was finalized on July 6, 2003. Construction began in March 2004, and the project was completed and transferred to the Afghan authorities in October 2006. The total cost of the first phase of the project was $11.5 million, according to the Shanghai Commerce Council.

The total cost of the first phase of the project was $11.5 million, according to the Shanghai Commerce Council. 

Phase-2 (captured by project ID # 69368): In 2010, the Chinese Government committed grant funding for Phase II of the Parwan Water Conservancy Restoration Project. The purpose of this project was to rehabilitate an irrigation canal in Parwan Province, which is one of the most agriculturally productive areas of Afghanistan. It involved enlarging the main canal, constructing additional gutters and retaining walls, and building fences around the Charikar pumping station and the Parwan Authority office. The total reported cost of this project is RMB 23 million. 

Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Co., Ltd. (JWHC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation began on December 31, 2010. The project was completed on June 15, 2012, and the formal project handover ceremony took place on August 15, 2012. Staff Note: The Chinese project title is 阿富汗帕尔旺水利增项工程 or 阿富汗帕尔旺水利工程修复（二期. For the time being, we assume that the full cost of the project (RMB 23 million) was the value of the grant funding provided by the Chinese Government. 

In a news article published by the Chinese Embassy Website, the funding for the project was drawn from the US$150 million that China has pledged in 2002 and is a sub-umbrella project of #34498 instead of a duplicate.

The main (85.578 km) irrigation canal was originally constructed with a grant from the Chinese Government in the late 1960s and 1970s. Construction was initiated on December 31, 1968 and completed on December 31, 1976. It was designed to irrigate 24,800 hectares (or 372,000 acres) of land.

Based on an interview with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Yings, this was the second 150 million CNY-grant that was offered by China. The agreement to provide the first 150 million CNY worth of grant was signed on 31 December 2011 (See Project ID#34601). Minister Fu Yings also said that China and Afghanistan would identify projects that could use the grant. STAFF_NOTE: This project was initially coded as being a duplicate of ID #34601, however, according to information published on the website of China's ECCO in Kabul, 150 million CNY assistance packages were pledged consecutively in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the CSIS report that China's grant to Afghanistan from 2002 to 2010 is about US$205.3 million while the report by the 'Diplomat' has mentioned that the total amount of grant from 2002 to 2011 is about US$250 million. The reports show that there is at least 150 million CNY that was provided to Afghanistan in 2011, and the 150 million CNY that was offer in 2012 is referring to a separate pledge made by China. Last, the article by Reuters suggest that China's offer of 150 million CNY was part of the strategic partnership agreement signed in 2012, thus further distinguishing this offer of 150 million CNY in aid in 2012 from the one made in 2011. A Joint Declaration between The People's Republic of China and The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on Establishing Strategic and Cooperative Partnership was then released on June 16 2012 which stated that both sides will 'continually strengthen the pragmatic cooperation in such fields as resources and energy development, infrastructure development, engineering and agriculture'.

The entire project will cost 250 million USD, with 162 million USD from China and the rest funded by Indonesia. China Exim Bank provided the preferential export buyer's credit worth 160 million USD for the construction of the bridge.

In December 2002, China extended a US$400 million preferential loan to Indonesia following Chinese President Jiang Zemin's pledge in March 2002. The loan, to finance infrastructure programs in Indonesia, is to be repaid in 15 years with a 7 year grace period and 3 percent interest rate. Indonesia plans to use the loan for infrastructure projects including the building of a power plant in Sumatra by the state-owned power company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (project #34922) and a railway track construction project in Java by the state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia.

In October 2003, the contract for the Labuhan Angin power plant project was signed between state-owned electricity company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and a Chinese contractor CMEC (China National Machinery & Equipment Import & Export Group Corp). 85% of the construction funds was provided by a preferential export buyer's credit by the Chinese government to Indonesia. The contract worth US$ 232 million came into effect in March 2005. The two-unit, 230-MW Labuhan Angin power station began commercial operations in 2008 and was successfully handed over in April 2009. An additional 115 MW power station is currently in the planning stage. The loan is part of an earlier loan agreement with China worth US$400 million. In December 2002, China extended a US$400 million preferential loan to Indonesia following Chinese President Jiang Zemin's pledge in March 2002. The loan, to finance infrastructure programs in Indonesia, is to be repaid in 15 years with a 7 year grace period and 3 percent interest rate. Indonesia plans to use the loan for infrastructure projects including the building of a power plant in Sumatra by the state-owned power company PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (project #34922) and a railway track construction project in Java by the state-owned railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia. In May 2004 Indonesia used US$70 million of the loan to continue construction of a 160 kilometer double track linking Cirebon in West Java to Kroya in Central Java. It also appears that Indonesia used US$160 million of the loan for the construction of Suramadu bridge (project #34757). China would subsequently add an additional loan of US$200 million for the Parit Baru power plant (#35240) and double-track railway in Java (#38862). Staff Note: Conflicting accounts on loan amount.

35020,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2012,China,,"China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), State-owned Company",Development of 1500 Housing Units (Phase 2),"On September 2, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Maldives signed an RMB 982,500,000 loan agreement for Phase 2 of Development of 1,500 Housing Units Project. The loan was export buyer's credit (see 'ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS'). The loan has a 20 year maturity, according an archived Sun Online article. After the loan is fully disbursed, the Government of Maldives was to pay RMB 17.74 million ($2.3 million USD or MVR35.5 million) yearly as interest during the grace period. By the end of the loan period in 2033, the government was to have paid $183.14 million USD (MVR2.8 billion).

The loan originally dates back to 2011, when the taking of the loan was submitted to the Maldivian parliament by then-President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed for the construction of 1,500 housing units in four southern atolls, according to Sun Online. However, to the lack of loan details, the Parliament Public Accounts Committee investigated it, and discovered that some details had changed, requiring furthering probing. The details of the loan was approved on December 29, 2011, but then the government requested changes to the loan, in order to finance the construction of 704 housing units in Hulhumalé. In July 2014, the Public Accounts Committee voted to approve the changes to the loan.

According to the President's Office, the project was intended to deal with housing shortages faced by young Maldivians. According to Raajje, the flats have three bedrooms, with attached bathrooms, in addition to a kitchen and a front room. The project broke ground on December 9, 2014, when the President of Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom laid the ‎foundation stone of the 704 housing units to be constructed in Hulhumalé., as reported by the President's Office. According to the Housing Development Corporation, Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure was implementing the project. According to Avas, the 1,500 housing units, which were built by contractor China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and dispersed across eight different islands across the Maldives, were officially completed and handed over on December 4, 2017.

A breakdown of the 1500 housing unit locations by island, taken from Avas, is as follows:
- Hulhumalé, Kaafu atoll – 704 housing units
- Hithadhoo, Addu atoll – 264 housing units
- Hulhumeedhoo, Addu atoll – 48 housing units
- Fuvahmulah, Gnaviyani atoll – 200 housing units
- Villingili, Gaafu Alif atoll – 52 housing units
- Gahdhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 50 housing units
- Thinadhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 120 housing units
- Madaveli, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 22 housing units
- Hoadehdhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 40 housing units

For the Thinadhoo Island project listed above, the inauguration ceremony occurred in 2015. 80 of the 120 housing units were designated for Thinadhoo residents, 25 of the 120 housing units were allotted for people who migrated to the island, and the rest were to be sold through open bidding, according to the Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure.

Disbursements per year of the China Eximbank loan proceeds were as follows, according to Maldives government sources (and denominated in local currency MVR): 
- 2013: 722,137,500 MVR (according to Budget in Statistics 2015)

China Export-Import Bank will provide US$102 miillion of the total project amount in the form of suppliers’ credit from CPECC. The $481 million project would provide a safer and cost-effective alternative for both crude and refined products transportation and added with the completion of the pipeline a more comprehensive, safer, cost effective, demand responsive and eco-friendly pipeline network will be available to meet the country’s growing needs for energy. The 817 km-long and 26 inch diameter pipeline has an initial capacity of transporting eight million tons refined petroleum products, and 12 million tons white oil per annum. The pipeline was earlier scheduled to be completed by June 2004, but later revised to October 2005. As of September 2004, 95% of the work had been completed. The testing of the pipeline would be conducted during October and November 2004 and was expected to become operational by end-November or early December. The project has been completed.

Out of the total cost of $481 million, the foreign component stands at $120 million, while local component stands at Rs 20.657 billion. The debt part of the foreign currency cost is being financed by export credit agencies (ECAs) from China through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor. Three major banks — HBL, UBL and NBP—will arrange Rs12.5 billion of Rs29 billion White Oil Pipeline Project of PAPCO. Around Rs10 billion would be floated as TFCs (term finance certificates) and the remaining amount would be in the form of redeemable preference shares. The financing arrangement also includes bridge financing of Rs5 billion by the consortium banks to be made available for the project. In this regard, a meeting of the chief executives of NBP, HBL, UBL and PAPCO was held at the NBP office and memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also signed. The Rs29 billion ($480 million) white oil pipeline project is achieving financial close and the entire debt financing of $360 million including Rs12.5 billion in local currency is being arranged whereas equity financing of $120 million is in place. For this project NBP will also provide a foreign currency loan of $18 million and issue a bank guarantee of $102 million for China Exim Bank related to suppliers’ credit from CPECC, which have been selected as EPC contractor for the project.

The project is being materialised by a joint venture, which consists of PARCO (51 % shares), Shell (26 %), Caltex (12 %) and Pakistan State Oil (11 % shares). The contractor of the laying the pipeline is CPECC. The project is to be implemented on build, own and operate (BOO) basis, with PARCO being the executing agency.

The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) claims that it is the largest hydropower project undertaken by WAPDA since the completion of Mangla, Tarbela and Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Projects. The Project is designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri 41 Km North East of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse is being constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 Km South of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 Km South of ChatterKalas.The Project will produce 5.15 Billion units of electricity annually. Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company Limited was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. On 7 July 2007, the Chinese consortium CGGC-CMEC (Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation) were awarded the contract to construct the dam and power station. The construction contract was settled at a cost of PKR 90.90 billion by the end of the year and in January 2008, the letter of commencement was issued. According to WAPDA, as of March 2018, 90%of the construction works have already been completed. According to a March 2018 Tariff Petition document issued by Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company Limited to Pakistan National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of PKR 506,579 million is estimated to be funded based on a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total debt component amounts to PKR 401,416 million, which is around 3823 USD million. According to the document, the debt portion consists of Foreign Relent Loans from GoP, cash development loans and local commercial financing. Foreign Relent Loans are raised by the Government of Pakistan and relent to NJHPC at a fixed rate set by Economic Affairs Division of Pakistan. Foreign Relent Loans received by NJHPC consist of Islamic Development Bank Loans IDB Istisna I &II of US$ 358 Million, China Exim Bank Loan I and II of US$ 1024 Million, Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development KFD loan I and II of US$ 74 Million, Saudi Fund for Development SFD Loan I and II of US$ 181 Million and OPEC Fund for International Development OFID Loan I and II of US$ 81 Million. The China Eximbank Loans are broken up into China Eximbank Loan 1 of 448 USD million and China Eximbank Loan 2 of 576 USD million. Both have a repayment period of 20 years and a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + 280 bps. As the relevant LIBOR interest rate was not explicitly identified in the document, the LIBOR rate at the time the project agreement was finalized or published would be used. As such, the 6 month LIBOR rate in March 2018 (2.32%) was used for the purpose of this project record. A interest rate of 5.12% is thus recorded. According to the Economic Affairs Division, as of 30th June 2017, the 448 USD million loan has been fully disbursed in the form of Preferential Buyer Credit, and 191.067 million USD of the 576 million USD loan has also been disbursed in the form of Preferential Buyer Credit. The same division also states that the 448 million USD loan was signed on 22 May 2013, and the 576 million USD loan was signed on 29 September 2016.

35582,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2011,China,"Unspecified Chinese Government Institution, Government Agency",,Concessional Loan for Designing/Planning/Construction of Stung Atay Pursat Dam in Cambodia (linked to #48921),"In 2010, China has agreed to design and construct the Stung Pursat Dam through a concessional loan of $63,134,700 USD. The goal of the project is to improve the lives and agriculture production of Cambodian farmers. The project can be linked back to late 2008, in which the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology has begun preliminary studies for the building of a series of dams across four provinces. The dams are aimed to provide the country with a more modern irrigation system as well as generate electricity for rural communities. In September 2008, it was reported that the ministry has aimed to build four dams in Pursat province that would supply irrigation to more than 35,000 hectares of land and generate as much as 300 megawatts of power for local communities. STAFF_NOTE: There are a number of dams in the province of Pursat that are in the pipeline and financed by the Chinese government, thus I am unsure which 'Stung Pursat Dam' that the Council for the Development of Cambodia(CDC) report is referring to. There are 'Stung Atay Pursat Dam', 'Stung Pursat I', 'Stung Pursat II', 'Stung Pursat Dam No.3' and 'Stung Pursat Dam No.5'. Based on several reports, I believe that this report is referring to 'Stung Atay Pursat Dam'. Based on the 'International Rivers' report, the expected completion year for the dam is 2015, which is similar to the completion date reported in the CDC Summary Report. Both reports has also stated that the dam is still under construction. Based on a report by Cambodia Development Resource Institute (CDRI) and published by the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) in 2011, both 'Stung Pursat I' and 'Stung Pursat II' are still under MOU study, thus the CDC report cannot be referring to this two projects as the the Pursat dam project in the CDC report had already been approved in 13 December 2010. There is also a very high probability that the CDC report is not referring to the 'Stung Pursat Dam No.3' and 'Stung Pursat Dam No.5' because both projects are estimated to cost US$60 million dollars and only be implemented in 2014 (based on the 2011 ADB report), while the CDC report mentioned a US$63 134 700 loan for a single dam, and is implemented before 2014. Thus further details found in this description will be referring to the 'Stung Atay Pursat Dam'. MORE RESEARCH will be needed to confidently pinpoint which dam project in the province of Pursat the CDC report is referring to. The Stung Atay Pursat Dam is a 120 (MW) Hydropower dam along the Atay River. its expected total project cost is US$225 million dollars and the construction is undertaken by Cambodia Hydropower Development Co Ltd (subsidary of China Datang Overseas Investment Co., Ltd.).

The building with the total space of 32, 580 square meters can be loaded up to 200 people in big Conference Hall and many other smaller rooms, and all are being used by many government's institutions under the Office of the Council of Ministers. The building has been used since February 2009, but it has not been officially inaugurated until 19 October 2010. While the construction of the building was initially reported to be funded by China's concessional loan, it was reported later that China has donated the office building as part of China's gift from the Chinese government to honour 50 years of diplomatic relations between Beijing and Phnom Penh (reported in article published by Xinhua News Agency, 12 August 2008). The 'Keynote Address at the Official Inauguration of the Office of the Council of Ministers' by Prime Minister Hun Sen further suggests that the office building was donated to the Cambodia government- Hun Sen conveyed his deep gratitude 'to the people and government of the People’s Republic of China for the valuable grant to build [the] buildings that will be used to improve efficiency and delivery of public services for Cambodian people.'",Completion,Grant,ODA-like,Development,150,Government and Civil Society,"http://primeministerhunsen.blogspot.sg/2010/10/keynote-address-at-official_24.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/council-ministers-building-delayed, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNHA000020050117e117000io&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Brc/pdf/03_chapter1.pdf, Academic Journal Article; https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/hun-sen-secures-400-million-china, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2010-10/19/c_13564809_2.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cdc.khmer.biz/reports/Individual_project_summary_report2008.asp?Record_Id=China-2006-SVIM858&DonorName=China, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://kh.china-embassy.org/chn/zgjx/t406015.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020071029e3at002gx&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks",9,,0,225070000,CNY,0.53539074,8.194316667,51301966.45,27466597.78,,12/28/2005,,12/31/2008,Cambodia,811,728,Cambodia,KHM,KH,116,522,,,,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Some Information,,20,,,Phnom Penh,"Mr. Lei Pengqin, leipqyahoo.com.cn (Chinese Embassy)",TRUE,FALSE

KPCL completed a EPC Tender evaluation on January 9th 2015, and awarded the EPC contract to Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation Consortium. The project will be undertaken on a build-own-operate-transfer basis. Construction began in 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2021. The project is designated a priority project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and a flagship project under Belt and Road Initiative. Project is part of the2 billion Karot power projects, focusing on hydro and wind power, under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor reported to be completed by 2018. The project will feature a single power generation complex with an installed capacity will be 720-megawatts with four units of 180-megawatts each. The power structure layout will include a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project itself is denominated as 80% in Punjab (powerhouse) and 20% in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (reservoirs). According to an interview with the chief accountant from China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, the total cost of the project is 1.75 billion USD, with a debt-equity ratio of 80:20. The project achieved financial closure on February 22, 2017. According to IJGlobal, the 80% debt component was financed by loans from China Development Bank, China Exim Bank, China Silk Road Fund and International Finance Corporation (IFC), each one worth 315 Million USD, along with an additional 100 Million USD loan from IFC. This project records the loans from the Chinese banks. For the equity component, China Three Gorges Corporation invested 316.20 Million USD, while Associated technologies invested 23.90 Million USD. The IMF puts the loan interest rate at 5.11%, with a maturity period of 12 years and a grace period of 5 years. It was additionally reported that there is a 30-year concession period. On April 20 2015, China's40 Billion Silk Road Fund signed a memorandum of understanding with China Three Gorges Corporation and the PPIB on the development of Pakistan's hydropower project, pledging to finance the project through equity investment in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, and participating in a loan syndicate made up of Chinese banks. As of 2017, the Silk Road Fund has disbursed 1.65 Billion USD. The Silk Road Fund also owns 15% of China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Company as of 2017. On March 14 2017, IFC announced that it will invest100 million in the Karot Hydropower Project, and reported that it acquired a 15% stake in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited in 2015. IFC stated that this investment is its first major collaboration with the China Export Import Bank, China Development Bank, and Silk Road Fund. The first unit is projected to begin power generation in 2020, coming online prior to its deadline. The Chinese firm in charge of the project will hand over this project to Pakistani government after the 30-year concession period has ended.

Kohala Hydro Company (Private) Limited (KHCL) is a project company (or special purpose vehicle) responsible for financing, designing, implementation, and maintaining the 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project. KHCL has a single shareholder: China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Ltd (CSAIL), which is an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan. 

The 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project is part of China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative and it is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and financed with a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. The total project cost is $2,760,170,000,000. A syndicate of Chinese banks is covering 85% ($1,642,300,000) of the total cost of the debt financing for the project ($1,932,120,000). The terms of the syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with China Development Bank and other Chinese banks are as follows: 18.5 year maturity, 6.5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.6%) plus a 4.60% margin. A syndicate of local Pakistani banks is covering 15% of the total cost of the debt financing for the project. 

The remaining cost of the project is to be covered through an $828.05 equity contribution from CSAIL.  To date, a $31.03 million equity contribution has been injected in KHCL by CSAIL (see project #54014). The 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project consists of a dam on River Jhelum, with twin 17.4 km long headrace tunnels which will end in the power house downstream on the River Jhelum. The curved concrete gravity dam with a crest elevation of 910 m, will have a maximum height of 69 meters and a top length of 270 meters. The main power station will be equipped with 4 vertical Francis turbine generator units, each of which has a capacity of 275 MW. An additional 24 MW will run on the ecological flow of the river downstream of the dam. The dam site is located in Siran Village on the Jhelum River, about 3 km downstream of the Kohala Bridge. The power plant is located in Barsala in District Muzafarabad. The catchment area of the dam site is 14,060 km2, with an average annual discharge of 302 m3/s and average annual runoff is 9.52 billion m3.  The total installed capacity of the hydropower station will be 1,124 MW, comprising 1,100 MW installed capacity for the main power station and 24 MW (2 x 12 MW) installed capacity for the ecological flow power station. 

A consortium of Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co. Ltd, & China Three Gorges Project Development Co. Ltd  was selected as the EPC contractor. Project construction began on September 6, 2018 and the project is expected to reach its commercial operation date (COD) on December 31, 2025. The project company will eventually sell all of the power that it generates to a Pakistani state-owned enterprise — called Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited — under a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province. It is home to more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on April 20, 2015, a commercial contract for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: was signed between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)]. 

Shortly thereafter, on December 21, 2015, the China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement, a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement, and an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement. The BCL (Project ID#53820 and loan ID#BC-OLL-2015) has a 5.2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. The PBC (Project ID#37280 and loan ID#PBC-OLL15-34377) has a 20 year maturity and an unknown interest rate. The GCL (Project ID#54420 and loan ID#GCL-OLL15-20559) has a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of this “mixed credit” from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  

The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and  serve 250,000 passengers per day. CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. However, it encountered various delays.   The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015.  

Popular protests  prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project.  This project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019.

The Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division records the face value of the loan [ID#GCL-2017-08-613] as $153 million. GCLs are RMB-denominated loans; however, the RMB value of the loan for this project is unknown. The terms of the loan are also unknown. As June 30, 2017, no disbursement had been made through this loan. 

The 1,200 kg Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-1), also called Remote Sensing Satellite System (RSSS), will operate at an altitude of 640 kilometres and will enable Pakistan to meet its imagery requirements in the areas of land mapping, agriculture classification and assessment, urban and rural planning, environmental monitoring, natural disaster management and water resource management for socio-economic development. It will also reportedly be used to provide remote sensing information for CPEC and Belt and Road projects in the region. 

The project contract was signed by China Great Wall Industry Group Co., Ltd. ('Great Wall Company') of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation Limited and the Pakistan Space and Outer Atmosphere Research Committee (SUPARCO) on April 20, 2016. According to the contract, China Great Wall Company was to provide a remote sensing satellite to Pakistan in the form of on-orbit delivery, along with a ground application system, ground monitoring and control system, as well as on-orbit testing, on-site support, training, insurance and related technical support services. 

The PRSS-1 satellite was successfully launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, China, on July 9, 2018. After successful tests in the orbit, PRSS-1 became fully operational on August 14, 2018. The control of PRSS-1 Satellite was successfully transferred to ground control stations in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Pakistan’s Planning Commission.

38083,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2015,China,,"Beijing Urban Construction Group Co., Ltd., State-owned Company; SinoHydro, State-owned Company",Velana International Airport (Ibrahim Nasir International Airport) Upgrade and Expansion,"According to the Presidency of the Republic of the Maldives, on September 16, 2014, during Xi Jinping's state visit to the Maldives, the Chinese Government and the Government of Maldives signed the 'Preliminary Contract Agreement on the Expansion and Upgrading of Ibrahim Nasir International Airport' that China would participate in the construction of an additional runway and bridge leading to the Velana International Airport (previously known as Ibrahim Nasir International airport) in Malé, Maldives.

On December 28, 2015, the Maldives secured a preferential buyer's credit loan agreement worth $373,838,500 USD (see Feb. 2019 'ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS') from the Export-Import Bank of China (see Feb. 2019 'ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS'). According to the Maldives Independent, the loan had a maturity period of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. According to Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL)'s Financial Year 2018 report, the interest rate was 3%. The principal was to be paid in thirty equal semiannual installments on January 21 and July 21 each year and the first repayment was to commence on the first available payment date falling five years after date of withdrawal (November 2, 2016). The Government of Maldives provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury then used proceeds from the Eximbank loan to on-lend to the MACL in the Maldivian Rufiyaa currency. As of December 31, 2018, $211,137,789 had been disbursed.

According to IJGlobal, in August 2016 total investment in the expansion of the airport is was $800 million USD. Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) was given the contract to expand the airport after a $511 million deal with India’s GMR Infrastructure was cancelled by the Maldivian government, according to Reuters and the BRICS Post.

The project involved the construction of a new 3,400 meters long and 65 meters wide runway, reclaim land, and develop a 45 million liter capacity fuel farm and an 80,000 ton cargo complex, according to the Maldives Independent in 2017. The project's groundbreaking ceremony was on February 27, 2017, according to the Chinese Embassy to the Maldives. Xinhua Silk Road Information Service reported that the paving construction of the new runway was completed on August 24, 2018. Then, according to Raajje, an A380 airplane landed on the newly constructed runway on September 18, 2018. The Global Times declared this moment as the completion of the Belt and Road initiative project.

This project is separate from, though related to, the Seaplane Facilities of the Velana International Airport Project, which is funded by CDB and captured in project ID #54268.

Velana International Airport (VIA) (IATA: MLE, ICAO: VRMM) is the main international airport in the Maldives. It is located on Hulhulé Island in the North Malé Atoll, nearby the capital island Malé.

The loan package came in the form of a 405,800,000 USD loan (project #38342) and a separate 1,791,608,000 CNY loan (project #55046). Both loans have a 20 year repayment period and a 2% interest rate. This project is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative and one of a series of loans described in umbrella project #52873. June 2014, Bangladesh and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a tunnel under the Karnaphuli River. In June 2015, the road transport and bridges ministry of Bangladesh signed a US$705 million deal with China Communication Construction Company to implement the multi-lane tunnel to be constructed beneath the Karnaphuli River in Chittagong. This bridge will be located next to the existing Kalurghat railway bridge. The project will cost around 1.07 billion USD total, with the government of Bangladesh covering the remainder of the expenses.

The project duration is expected to be 5 years.

The grace period is not included to avoid overstating the volume of Chinese giving.

China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau will construct the mooring platform, the 146km of underwater pipelines, and the 74km of on-land pipelines. The terms of the concessional loan are 30 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2.25% interest rate. In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received the technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, would review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm would submit financial offer on completion of the review. The project was expected to take 36 months, but 19 months into the project (October 2018), the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau had only completed initial surveying and some designing. In addition to providing the 82.56 million USD concessional loan, the Chinese EXIM Bank also provided467.8 million in preferential buyer's credits for this same project (project ID #53584).",Implementation,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),ODA-like,Development,320,"Industry, Mining, Construction","http://bd.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201508/20150801077609.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://bd2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralcooperation/bilateralagreement/201005/20100506913230.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.observerbd.com/2015/03/01/75302.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.erl.com.bd/spm.php, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://newagebd.net/44171/dhaka-sends-revised-list-of-15-projects-involving-10b-for-chinese-assistance/#sthash.q474dHAb.dpbs, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.daily-sun.com/details_Chinese-firm-wants-to-invest-$325m-at-5.1pc-interest-rate_347_1_3_1_2.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-china-joint-statement-28234, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://newagebd.net/94791/china-agrees-to-invest-in-10-large-infrastructure-projects/#sthash.Bba7bftV.dpbs, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2015/03/12/84627/print, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:AjcC1Ypmbm0J:bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-1358272-1.shtml+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=sg, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://energybangla.com/550-4m-single-point-mooring-project-hits-snag/, Media Report, including Wikileaks",11,,0,82560000,USD,1,1,82560000,82560000,,,,,Bangladesh,771,666,Bangladesh,BGD,BD,50,513,BGD.2_1,Chittagong,BGD.2.6_1,Cox'S Bazar,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Concessional,2.25,30,5,59.64,Bay of Bengal; Chittagong,,TRUE,FALSE

An agreement to this effect was signed and exchanged at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, Kathmandu, Nepal, on June 25, 2013. The agreement was signed by Mr. Shanta Raj Subedi, Finance Secretary and Mr. Jiang Zengwei, Vice Minister, Ministry of Commerce, Government of People's Republic of China on behalf of the Government of Nepal and the Government of the People's Republic of China, respectively. The project involved the construction 19 individual buildings, including a teaching building, dormitory building, covered hall, indoor and outdoor training venue, canteen, stadium, and swimming pool. The total construction area was about 15,000 square meters. China Railway 14th Bureau Group was responsible for project implementation. The training academy is located on a mountain slope at Chandragiri municipality on the outskirts of Kathmandu and it is the first of its kind in Nepal. The construction of the training academy began on April 16, 2015, just a few days ahead of a devastating earthquake, and it was completed on May 15, 2017.  The official handover ceremony took place on June 30, 2017. An official inauguration ceremony took place on March 19, 2018.

The financing amount is 455 million USD. The loan has 13 years of maturity, which includes 3 years of grace period. The $808.4 million power plant in Lontar, Banten (known as Banten 3 or Banten Lontar), has a capacity of 945 MW (3 x 315 MW) and was built by a consortium that included Chinese power equipment giant Dongfang Electric Corp. and Indonesian Dalle Energy. 28 December 2012 marked the handing over ceremony of the structures and operations of power generators that has been completed, from China to Indonesia. The plant is currently still in operation. The project is part of the Fast Track Program, which is a plan by the Indonesian government to add power plants around the country, which total to about 10000 MW. The program covers the construction of 33 (some sources state 32, while others state 35) power plants, 10 of them in Java and Bali, with 23 located off the two main islands, said Rudiantara, PLN's vice president director. So far contracts for 32 power plants have been signed, and most of these have now reached the construction phase. However, the investors have suspended temporarily the release of further disbursements, asking for an increase in the interest rates for both the funds that have been cashed in, as well as the funds that are now frozen. Furthermore, disbursements are being suspended pending the outcome of another project. Merpati Airlines committed to loan money from China to purchase Chinese aircrafts. However, Merpati reneged on its loan due to financial difficulty. Since then, the governments had to step in to proceed with discussions. It seems like some disbursements have still been received at different points in time. PLN have managed to secure around 65 percent of the total financing needed. On the other hand, for several smaller power-plant projects outside of Java Island, PLN negotiated with the Association of Provincial Development Banks (Asbanda) to provide Rp 4.5 trillion in financing. China Development Bank pulled out of financing the 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant project in JENEPONTO (SOUTH SULAWESI) sponsored by PT Bosowa Corp, the largest diversified business group in eastern Indonesia. There has been little information on all the projects that have been cancelled or successfully funded after the suspensions in funding. However, some information on several projects is available and have individual project records with updated information.

38601,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2009,China,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",,Exim Bank export buyer's credit for construction of Aceh power plant (Fast-track program),"In 2009, China Exim Bank loans US$124 million in export buyer's credit to Indonesia for Aceh power plant. The Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati witnessed the signing of the agreement. The plant is 2x110 MW units, which should start up in early 2011. The loan has a 15-year maturity, with a three-year grace period. In August 2014, the 2x110MW power plants were completed and commercially operational. The project is part of the Fast Track Program, which is a plan by the Indonesian government to add power plants around the country, which total to about 10000 MW. The program covers the construction of 33 (some sources state 32, while others state 35) power plants, 10 of them in Java and Bali, with 23 located off the two main islands, said Rudiantara, PLN's vice president director. So far contracts for 32 power plants have been signed, and most of these have now reached the construction phase. However, the investors have suspended temporarily the release of further disbursements, asking for an increase in the interest rates for both the funds that have been cashed in, as well as the funds that are now frozen. Furthermore, disbursements are being suspended pending the outcome of another project. Merpati Airlines committed to loan money from China to purchase Chinese aircrafts. However, Merpati reneged on its loan due to financial difficulty. Since then, the governments had to step in to proceed with discussions. It seems like some disbursements have still been received at different points in time. PLN have managed to secure around 65 percent of the total financing needed. On the other hand, for several smaller power-plant projects outside of Java Island, PLN negotiated with the Association of Provincial Development Banks (Asbanda) to provide Rp 4.5 trillion in financing. China Development Bank pulled out of financing the 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant project in Jeneponto (South Sulawesi) sponsored by PT Bosowa Corp, the largest diversified business group in eastern Indonesia.

The plant is built on a 83-hectare site in Sumur Adem village in Indramayu, West Java and is one of the power plants in the first phase of the government's 10,000 MW fast-track program. The construction of the Indramayu plant began in 2007, and was contracted to a consortium consisting of the China National Machinery Industry Corporation, the China National Electric Equipment Corporation and PT Penta Adi Samudera as the contractor. The total investment required to set up the power plant reached US$696.73 million plus Rp 1.5 trillion. Of this, the US$592 million syndicated loan was arranged by a Bank of China-led consortium of banks for PLN Persero in May 2008. The deal carries a tenor of 13 years, with a three-year period of grace. Along with China Export-Import Bank, BNP Paribas, China Construction Bank, China Development Bank, ICBC, Société Générale and China Citic joined the list of mandated lead arrangers. Nine banks joined the senior lead arranger group: ANZ Bank, Bayerische Landesbank, Calyon, Credit Suisse, Fortis, ING, Natixis, RBS and WestLB. Lead arrangers were Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC). Sinosure (China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation) is insuring 95% of the loan, and the Indonesian ministry of finance is providing a full guarantee. Despite the fact that the facility was heavily oversubscribed, Indonesia chose to take only US$592 million, which is 85% of the total contract price. The remaining 15% of the total cost will be provided in local currency financing arrangements by Indonesian banks. The 1st and 2nd unit of the 3x330MW power plant started commercial operations in January and May 2011 respectively, while the 3rd unit passed the performance testing in September 2011.

This PBC carries the following terms: 2% interest rate. 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. 

The objective of the purpose of the project is to construct an expressway in the outskirts of Colombo which connects with the Southern Expressway and other national roads radiating from Colombo city in order to mitigate traffic congestion in the Colombo Metropolitan Region and enhance connectivity with other regions of the country, thereby contributing to the strengthening of economic development among the regions in Sri Lanka. The Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is located at the Colombo Metropolitan Region and passes through two administrative districts, namely Colombo and Gampaha. 

The OCH Project consists of three main sections: Phase I runs from Kottawa to Kaduwela (11.0 km) (Phase I); Phase II runs from Kaduwela to Kadawatha (8.9 km); and Phase III runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (9.32 km). Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced on August 20, 2014. Its originally anticipated completion date was June 30, 2019. 

Phase III of the Outer Circular Highway Project involves the construction of a 9.32 km segment of the Outer Circular Highway that runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya. A detailed map of the route of Phase III of the OCH Project is available within Annexure - 05 of the following document: https://mohsl.gov.lk/downloads/1565995085.pdf.

The agreement was signed during Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif official visit to China in early July 2013, and Huawei has been assigned the task in this regard. The project is expected to be completed within a span of two years. The Pakistan government said that it will deploy the system at a cost of 3.7 billion rupees between Pakistan and China for security of information. The project would be funded within Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) and out of a Chinese soft loan. The project involves Rs 3.2 billion foreign exchange component (FEC). The project was deliberated at a recent meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) under the chairmanship Finance Minister Dr. Abdul Hafeez Shakih, and consists of laying 820 km of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) along the Karakaram Highway, from Rawalpindi to Khunjrab Pass (Chinese border via Mansehra, Chilas, Danyore (Gligit), Karimabad and Sust). Construction began October 2015. Financing will reportedly come in for of concessional loan of 2% from China Exim Bank. The project's expected cost is44M. China reportedly released11.24M for the project's implementation during this time period; for now, transaction amount is recorded as that already disbursed. The Pakistani Ministry of Planning,Development & Reform reports that, up to June 2016, 1,377.4 million Rupees have been disbursed, which corresponds roughly to the USD amount mentioned above. The Pak-China Optical Fiber Cable Project is a first of its kind project under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which gives China alternate and shorter access for transit telecom traffic to Europe, Middle East and Africa. The project features the development of communication infrastructure of around 820 km underground OFC from Rawalpindi to Khunjerab and 172 km aerial OFC from Karimabad to Khunjerab to supplement in landslide prone areas. It provides 26 high capacity microwave links as backup to OFC network and 9 node centers in different locations along Rawalpindi-Khunjerab belt. The work on the project was formally launched in 2016 and has been completed in a record two years. The project is a collaboration between Special Communications Organization, China Telecom Global and Pakistan Telecommunication Company. In January 2017, Pakistan's Information Technology and Telecom Division contributed 72 million Pakistani rupees towards project construction of OFC system between Pakistan and China for international connectivity of voice/data traffic (SCO).",Implementation,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),OOF-like,Development,220,Communications,"http://www.mofa.gov.pk/chile/pr-details.php?prID=2733, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://propakistani.pk/2010/12/29/pakistan-to-deploy-fiber-optic-cable-to-connect-with-china/, Other; http://www.dawn.com/news/1033788, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://propakistani.pk/2016/05/19/ground-breaking-of-44-million-pak-china-fiber-optic-cable-today/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/40, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.cpecinfo.com/telecommunication.php, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_18/13-Transport_and_Communications.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/frmDetails.aspx, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/EAD/2018/Final%20PCP%20Year%20Book%202016-17%20.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/EAD/2018/Website%20Year%20Book%202015-2016.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/budget/Estimates_of_Foreign_Assistant_2017_18.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/8csdpteq2a5b3lj/2016%20Government%20of%20Pakistan%20Bond%20Prospectus.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/budget/foreign_assistance_2015_16.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/ead/userfiles1/file/Trainings/Website%20Year%20Book%202014--15.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.cpecinfo.com/news/optic-fibre-cable-project-of-cpec-undergoing-completion-at-a-fast-pace/NTcxNw==, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_18/Economic_Survey_2017_18.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.pc.gov.pk/uploads/archives/Details_of_Rleases_2016-17(06-01-2017).pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://tribune.com.pk/story/1669931/2-apbf-foresees-massive-boost-industry/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=NINTPK0020170118ed1i00035&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/du/article.aspx/?accessionno=IARPAK0020160604ec5v00001&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=&cat=a, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/dl/gbdqzn/upload/bajisitan.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",21,,0,11240000,USD,1.0378199,1,10830395.52,11240000,,,,,Pakistan,770,665,Pakistan,PAK,PK,586,564,PAK.7_1,Punjab,PAK.7.7_1,Rawalpindi,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Concessional,2,,,,Rawalpindi to Khunjrab Pass,,TRUE,FALSE

SLPA is the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. 

The BCL carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month Libor + a 4% margin, 15 year maturity, 4 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. The GCL (worth $158,358,086) carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced by RMB 300 million (to RMB 700 million). The BCL is recorded in Project ID#39025. The PBC is recorded in Project ID#39023.  The GCL [China Eximbank GCL no. 2012(22) Total No 424] is recorded in Project ID#39024.  

Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. 

The contractors responsible for project implementation were China Communications Construction Company and China Harbour Engineering Com. Ltd. Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project was formally launched on November 18, 2010. However, construction did not begin until September 2012. The project was originally slated for completion in November 2015. However, the project encountered various delays and problems.  As of December 31, 2017, the project had achieved 96% physical completion rate.  A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017.  

Hambantota port ultimately proved to be commercially nonviable under host country ownership, and the Sri Lankan government could not service its loans to China Eximbank.  China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — eventually offered to effectively convert the debt into equity by providing a cash payment of US$1.1 billion to SLPA in exchange for an 85 percent ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years. CMPH therefore absorbed the risk of managing a stranded asset that would have otherwise been borne by the Sri Lankan government. SLPA finalized it concession agreement with CMPH on July 29, 2017.

SLPA is the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. 

The BCL carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month Libor + a 4% margin, 15 year maturity, 4 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee.

Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. 

The contractors responsible for project implementation were China Communications Construction Company and China Harbour Engineering Com. Ltd. Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project was formally launched on November 18, 2010. However, construction did not begin until September 2012. The project was originally slated for completion in November 2015. However, the project encountered various delays and problems.  As of December 31, 2017, the project had achieved 96% physical completion rate.  A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. 

Hambantota port ultimately proved to be commercially nonviable under host country ownership, and the Sri Lankan government could not service its loans to China Eximbank.  China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — eventually offered to effectively convert the debt into equity by providing a cash payment of US$1.1 billion to SLPA in exchange for an 85 percent ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years. CMPH therefore absorbed the risk of managing a stranded asset that would have otherwise been borne by the Sri Lankan government. SLPA finalized it concession agreement with CMPH on July 29, 2017.  

The Hambantota Port (also known as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port) is a maritime port in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. Detailed locational coordinates available at https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Magampura_Mahinda_Rajapaksa_Port&params=06_07_10_N_81_06_29_E_region:LK.

The loan carried the following terms: a variable interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2.90% margin, a grace period of 4 years, a 16 year maturity, a 0.5% management fee, and a 5.9% risk (insurance) premium. 

The interest rate of the CDB loan that supported this project is coded based on the 6-month LIBOR at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. The interest rate was therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%.

The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the 'Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka', was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 

To achieve these goals, a 61 m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.   

Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013.  On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 

The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

The project involves the realignment the portion of the highway that was submerged under water during the Attabad landslide in 2010. The cost of the project was US$275 million. It was based on 85% funding in foreign currency from China Exim Bank's concessional loan, and 15% in local currency by the Pakistan government. The project included the realignment of roads, construction of 5 tunnels with total length of 7.12 km, 78 culverts and 2 bridges. The application for the loan is under process with Economic Affair Division (EAD). Work would be completed in 2 years after commencement subject to availability and release of funds. The project was completed on Sept 14, 2015. The final year book report by the Pakistani government for 2016-2017 records a Preferential Buyer's Credit loan of USD259 million and that the project was completed on 30-06-2017. STAFF_NOTE: The KKH highway had been updated previous to the realignment by China. For details on this project, see #35739. Note that the previous upgrading and the realignment of the KKH highway are jointly called the Phase-I project of KKH Highway. STAFF_NOTE: There is a significant portion of contradicting information on the transaction in Pakistani finance ministry's Economic Affairs Division Year Book reports. Coder did not code these information and deferred to the report mentioned above as the more reliable source. See below for these contradicting reports. A Pakistani ministry of finance monthly project status report in August 2016 records the project as a loan of CNY259 million, which is slightly smaller than the amount recorded above. Moreover, the source suggested that part of the loan was fulfilled in August 2016, which contradicts the source above suggesting that the project was complete on September 14, 2015. A Pakistani Economic Affairs Division Year Book in the fiscal year of 2016/17 confirms the amount of 259 million USD, and also suggests that by 30 June 2017, 253.3 million of the total amount has been disbursed. It is therefore unlikely that the project has been finished, changed the project status to implementation. Stage 2 confirmation is needed here. According to Pakistan Ministry of Finance Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2015-2016, China is estimated to disburse 3,744.874 million Pakistani rupees to the project in 2014-2015, according to the revised budget estimate. In the Estimates for 2016-2017, the revised budget for 2015-2016 states that China likely loaned 7,288.920 million Pakistani rupees, or 54 million USD, for this project during the year. The Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2017-2018 initially estimated that 200 million Pakistani rupees would be loaned in 2016-2017, but the revised estimate states that 0 funds were likely to be disbursed during the year.

Aktobe maintains a volume of 5 million tons of copper. The money was used to construct Aktogay mine. First copper cathode production from oxide ore occurred in December 2015, whilst first copper in concentrate output from sulphide ore began in February 2017. The main sulphide concentrator was constructed by Nonferrous China (NFC). The project capital cost is expected to be in the region of2.1 billion. The mine is expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually in 2015. On February 16, 2012 the loan was finalized and signed as two transactions one for RMB 1 billion (158 million), the other for 1.34 billion USD. It is being developed as an open-pit mine including an on-site concentrator and construction work started in the first half of 2013. The Facility has a final maturity of 15 years from the date of first drawing. The total Aktogay Facility of approximately1.5 billion is comprised of two separate agreements, a USD agreement for up to1.34 billion and an RMB agreement for up to RMB 1.0 billion (approx158 million). Both agreements are reportedly on essentially similar terms and conditions, except that proceeds drawn under the RMB agreement can only be applied towards payments to Chinese suppliers for equipment, materials and services sourced from China. The interest rate on the USD agreement is set with reference to USD LIBOR, while the RMB agreement is at the applicable benchmark rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC).

JSC KazTransGas and China National Petroleum Corporation each have 50% ownership stake in Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP.  The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1454 km long gas pipeline that will run through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases. 

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 and completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 6 bcm per year.  It involved 1143.2 km of pipeline construction from the Bozoy gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe oblast to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam region of South-Kazakhstan oblast. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe oblast, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in Kyzylorda oblasts and an emergency-response center in Shornak within South-Kazakhstan oblast, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas ppeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South-Kazakhstan oblasts. 

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was completed on December 30, 2016. It involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau oblast to Bozoy settlement in the Aktobe oblast. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in Kyzylorda oblast, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau oblast, the SCADA central dispatch control  in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South-Kazakhstan oblasts. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, which increased the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas deliveries to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of 5 billion cubic meter of natural gas (bcm) during the period from 15 October 2017 until 14 October 2018. 

The price of gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement is linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. Negotiations are ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expects the transportation of gas to China to increase in the coming years and, in order to facilitate such transportation, plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019.

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 million syndicated loan with China Development Bank and Bank of China on December 11, 2012 (Project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.7% per annum for the duration of the guarantee period and, thereafter, at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.2% per annum. The loan matures on 11 March 2028. The loan is secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP then signed a $700 million syndicated loan with China Development Bank and Bank of China for Phase II of the project on September 17, 2015 (Project ID#40362).  CDB and Bank of China each reportedly contributed $350 million. This loan reportedly carries a 15 year maturity; however, the interest rate of the loan is unknown.

This 1454 km pipeline runs through runs through the territory of Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South-Kazakhstan oblasts. The first phase of the project (Project ID#39562) involved 1143.2 km of pipeline construction from the Bozoy gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe oblast to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam region of South-Kazakhstan oblast.

39620,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2013,China,,"Tebian Electric Apparatus, Private Sector",China loans 386 million USD for modernization of Bishkek Thermal Power Plant,"On September 11, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Kyrgyz Republic’s Ministry of Finance signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 38 TOTAL NO. (282)] for the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project. The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.25% commitment fee, and 0.18% management fee.  

The proceeds from this loan were to be used to finance a commercial contract (number D-166-21/322) between the Joint Stock Company (JSC) “Electric Power Plants of Kyrgyzstan” and Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA). This project sought to install two turbines (units 12 and 13) with a capacity of 150 megawatts at the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant (TPP). As a result, the capacity of Bishkek TPP was expected to increase by 125 megawatts. Prior to project completion, the annual output of electricity at the TPP was one billion kWh. After its modernization through the China Eximbank-financed project, the production of the TPP was expected to reach 1.8 billion kWh. Heat production was also expected to increase from two million gigacalories to three million gigacalories per year.  The project began implementation on April 26, 2014 and it was successfully completed on August 30, 2017. 

However, this project was plagued by controversy. In 2015, the Chamber of Audits, a state body tasked with overseeing government spending, issued a report questioning why the TBEA contract was not put out to tender when other companies were interested in bidding. Auditors also found that no technical feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the needs and costs of the project. Nurlan Omurkul, who was chief of the Bishkek TPP, said that he had harbored strong doubts about hiring a company with no track record of building power stations, but that he had been badgered by senior Kyrgyz officials to endorse a decision that he said had obviously already been made. He told the New York Times that “I’ve worked my whole life in power and heating plants and knew all along that the Chinese price of $386 million was too expensive.” Another Chinese company, China Machinery Engineering Corporation, offered a lower bid, $356 million, according to a parliamentary commission. But the Chinese Embassy reportedly insisted that its offer be dismissed. Eventually, the country’s former Prime Minister (Jantoro Satybaldiev), former mayor of Bishkek (Kubanychbek Kulmatov), and former Energy Minister (Osmonbek Artykbaev) were arrested on corruption charges and accused of using their positions to lobby for the interests of a Chinese company (TBEA) in the selection process of the contractor for the project. Prosecutors in the case claimed that rigged bidding and inflated pricing would cost the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as much as $111,252,797.

39644,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2006,China,,"Tebian Electric Apparatus, Private Sector","EXIM Bank loans 309,592,800 USD for North-South power transmission line","In March 2006, the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a MoU for projects proposed by Tajikistan (see pg. 14 of 'China as an Emerging Donor in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan'). Later that year, on December 21, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China provided a $267,219,451 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan to the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project (see pg. 37 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'; for the transaction amount, see pg. 87 of 'Power Utility Financial Recovery Program-for-Results (P168211) Program Technical Assessment Final Report'). The loan terms carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see 'List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018'). The initial estimated value of the project was $281.3 million USD (see pg. 32 of 'Tajikistan Policy Notes on Public Expenditures'). 

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement (No. BLA06015, #6015) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 21, 2006 and June 21, 2026. As of December 31, 2018, $2,519,773 USD was outstanding (see pg. 37 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of 'Consolidated financial statements...').

The purpose of this project was to construct a 500 kV electricity transmission line that would connect the northern Sughd region to the national grid (see pg. 32 of 'Tajikistan Policy Notes...'). According to Xinhua, the project also intended to realize the effective dispatching of electricity between Dushanbe and Khujand, completely solve the problem of power shortage in the south during the dry season in winter, build the transmission channel for the implementation of the Tajik Hydropower Strategy, improve the safety, stability, and reliability of the power grid, and reduce the loss of electricity through transmission from 14% to 3.2%.

Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for project implementation (see pg. 11 of 'BRI in Central Asia: Energy Connectivity Projects'). Construction began on September 16, 2006, after a ceremony attended by Wen Jiabao and President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, according to the Chinese Embassy. The North-South transmission line has been operational since November 29, 2009, according to TBEA. The construction of transmission line reportedly enabled Tajikistan to become independent of the Uzbek power transmission network and to distribute electricity throughout the country (see pg. 11 of 'BRI in Central Asia...').

The loan carried an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.5%. Sinosure provided insurance. CITIC Group and Uzkimyosanoat were responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of its contract, Citic Pacific Ltd. designed and constructed the plant on a turnkey basis (in which CITIC would turn over the plant after a certain number of years of its operation) at a cost of $32.3 million. The plant was officially commissioned in August 2006.  This project sought to achieve a production capacity of 100,000 tons of soda ash per year  — by mining limestone from the Jamansay (Dzhamansay) quarry and the Barsakelmes field salt field in Karakalpakstan (an autonomous republic in north-western Uzbekistan). The main consumers of soda plant are Uzbek enterprises that produce household chemicals and building materials, including various types of glass. Then, in 2012, the capacity of the plant was expanded to 200,000 tons per year, which was partially financed by a loan from China's Eximbank (see Project ID #54832).

39997,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2012,China,,,"Line C of Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline, Kazakhstan section (linked to #40833, #39955, #54489)","The Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline, which is also known as the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline, is a 1,873-km gas pipeline that connects Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D), with A,B,C parallel to each other. The pipeline starts at Gedaim on the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, runs through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and ends at Horgos in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID #40834) and Line C (ID #39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (#39955) runs through Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C are providing 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum, while Line D is still under construction. There are segments of each line constructed within Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan 

This project records the financing of the Kazakhstan segment of Line C. Construction of Line C began on January 16, 2013. The line went into operation on May 31, 2014. Line C was officially commissioned on July 9, 2015.  Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017.  With a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, Line C’s pipe diameter is 1,219mm, 152mm larger than Line A/B. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C by the end of 2015, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline will reportedly reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum. This equals to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption, and would substitute 73 million tons of standard coal, cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons every year, respectively.  JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with CNPC (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each hold 50% equity stake in AGP. 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a U.S.$4.7 billion syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank and Bank of China for the purposes of financing the construction of line C of the 'Kazakhstan-China' pipeline. Amounts borrowed under the facility accrue interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus a 2.35 percent margin during the guarantee period and three-month LIBOR plus by 3.45 percent margin per annum thereafter. The borrowed amounts must be repaid starting from June 2017 until 27 December 2027. The loan is secured by a 'ship or pay' transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments and guaranteed by CNPC. As at 30 June 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $3.3 million. According to this information, the interest rate is recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%; grace period = 4.5 years; repayment period = 10.5 years, maturity period = 15 years.

Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline (also known as the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline) is 1830 km in length. It starts at the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan border and ends at Horgos, in the Xinjiang region of China.

(131). In it, Eximbank agreed to provide the Tajik Ministry of Finance with a $35,055,003 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 220 V Khujand-Ayni Power Transmission Line Project (for commitment date, see 'ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN of October 4, 2013 No. 445'; for loan amount, see 'May 2018 Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS China Specific Projects'). The PBC loan carried the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and 2% interest rate (see 'List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018'). The project had a total value of $36.9 million USD (see pg.32 of 'Tajikistan Policy Notes on Public Expenditures').

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend to OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” (through a subsidiary loan agreement -- No. 2010 (024) TOTAL (170) – 029 BT) at a 3% interest rate between December 15, 2010 and September 21, 2031 (see pg. 37 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). 

The project involved the construction of a 118 km, 220 kV transmission line from Khujand to Ayni, according to Asia-Plus. The transmission line also involved the construction of the Ayni and Shakhristan substations. The Khujand-Ayni power transmission line was intended to connect the Zarafshon Valley to the unified power system through the 500 kV South-North power grid (see pg.32 of 'Tajikistan Policy Notes on Public Expenditures').

The 100 million RMB was reportedly the total value of interest-free and concessional loans given by the bank to the Kyrgyz government for the construction of a paper mill. According to the Kyrgyzstan AMP, there were two credits extended by China for the construction of the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Mill in Tokmok, which is located in the Chuy valley. The first credit was extended in 1996 (AMP ID 87188512380) and the second was extended in 1998 (AMP ID 87188512381). The debt has been restructured in pursuance of the resolution of the Paris Club of creditors on the consolidation of the Kyrgyz Republic's debt. In accordance with the agreement, the debt to be serviced (interest, plus the principal sum) is to be restructured. Media reported that the sum of payments deferred between 2001 and 2004 will total 1.98m yuan (about 250,000 dollars), which is to be paid within 10 years, starting from 2007. However, the value of 100 million yuan has been recorded as the restructured debt amount, because a MOFCOM source in 2015 reported that as of 2015, Kyrgyzstan still owes China 9,800,000 USD (around 40 million RMB in 2003) for the paper mill loans, and that in 2014 Kyrgyzstan had negotiated the return of 60,200,000 RMB to China by 2017. The sum of both values is close to the 100 million RMB that was reportedly loaned to Kyrgyzstan, suggesting that that was the total amount of debt that had been rescheduled in 2003. . It should also be noted that COMPLANT, the Chinese contractor for the paper mill project, reported a total project cost of 129,016,065 RMB, and People Daily report in 2002 put the total Chinese loan amount at 150,000,000 RMB.

40362,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2015,China,,,China loan syndicate funds Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline (Additional Financing) (link to #39562),"On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP was established in the Republic of Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas and China National Petroleum Corporation each have 50% ownership stake in Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP.  The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1454 km long gas pipeline that will run through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases. 

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 and completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 6 bcm per year.  It involved 1143.2 km of pipeline construction from the Bozoy gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe oblast to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam region of South-Kazakhstan oblast. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe oblast, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in Kyzylorda oblasts and an emergency-response center in Shornak within South-Kazakhstan oblast, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas ppeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South-Kazakhstan oblasts. 

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was completed on December 30, 2016. It involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau oblast to Bozoy settlement in the Aktobe oblast. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in Kyzylorda oblast, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau oblast, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South-Kazakhstan oblasts. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, which increased the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas deliveries to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of 5 billion cubic meter of natural gas (bcm) during the period from 15 October 2017 until 14 October 2018. 

The price of gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement is linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. Negotiations are ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expects the transportation of gas to China to increase in the coming years and, in order to facilitate such transportation, plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019. 

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 million syndicated loan with China Development Bank and Bank of China on December 11, 2012 (Project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.7% per annum for the duration of the guarantee period and, thereafter, at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.2% per annum. The loan matures on 11 March 2028. The loan is secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP then signed a $700 million syndicated loan with China Development Bank and Bank of China for Phase II of the project on September 17, 2015 (Project ID#40362).  CDB and Bank of China each reportedly contributed $350 million. This loan reportedly carries a 15 year maturity; however, the interest rate of the loan is unknown

This 1454 km pipeline runs through runs through the territory of Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South-Kazakhstan oblasts. The first phase of the project (Project ID#39562) involved 1143.2 km of pipeline construction from the Bozoy gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe oblast to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam region of South-Kazakhstan oblast.

Aktobe maintains a volume of 5 million tons of copper. The money was used to construct Aktogay mine. First copper cathode production from oxide ore occurred in December 2015, whilst first copper in concentrate output from sulphide ore began in February 2017. The main sulphide concentrator was constructed by Nonferrous China (NFC). The project capital cost is expected to be in the region of2.1 billion. The mine is expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually in 2015. On February 16, 2012 the loan was finalized and signed as two transactions one for RMB 1 billion (158 million), the other for 1.34 billion USD. It is being developed as an open-pit mine including an on-site concentrator and construction work started in the first half of 2013. The Facility has a final maturity of 15 years from the date of first drawing. The total Aktogay Facility of approximately1.5 billion is comprised of two separate agreements, a USD agreement for up to1.34 billion and an RMB agreement for up to RMB 1.0 billion (approx158 million). Both agreements are reportedly on essentially similar terms and conditions, except that proceeds drawn under the RMB agreement can only be applied towards payments to Chinese suppliers for equipment, materials and services sourced from China. The interest rate on the USD agreement is set with reference to USD LIBOR, while the RMB agreement is at the applicable benchmark rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC).

The communication satellite was to be constructed with 30 year transponders, 12 in C-Band and 18 in Ku-Band, each of 36 MHz Bandwidth. Then, in September 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a framework agreement. Under the terms of the framework agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide up to RMB 1.385 billion for the Paksat-1R Project. Any subsidiary loans under this framework agreement would bear the following terms: a 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, and a 5 year grace period. 

Shortly thereafter, on October 15, 2009, Deputy Director of the China Eximbank and the Pakistani Ambassador to China signed a RMB 800 million loan agreement for the Paksat-1R Project (Project ID#43298). China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan also signed an RMB 86.5 million loan agreement for the construction of a ground control facility on October 29, 2010 (see Project ID #36953).

On August 12, 2011, at the Chinese Xichang Satellite Launch Center, Pakistan’s first Communications Satellite PAKSAT-1R, as part of Pakistan’s Space Programme 2040, was launched. The launch was witnessed by Pakistani Secretary Defence Lt Gen Syed Athar Ali (R), Secretary Foreign Affairs, Salman Bashir, Director General, Strategic Plans Division Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai (R) and Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Muhammad Masood Khan. Launched on the Long March 3B rocket, the Paksat-1R satellite has a design life of 15 years with initial goals to provide broadband internet access, digital television broadcasting, remote and rural telephony, emergency communications, tele-education and tele-medicine services across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, East Africa and the Far East. The satellite successfully took over the operations of its predecessor, the PakSat-1E satellite leased by Pakistan, in geostationary orbit at 38° East.  The commercial services of the satellite were inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on November 5, 2011 from the satellite ground station located near Lahore.

43724,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2011,China,,,China EXIM Bank loans Tajikistan 26.5 million USD for construction of unified power system,"On July 20, 2011, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $26,463,789 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the Unified Power System in Northern Tajikistan Project (see 'Tajikistan: Policy Notes on Public Expenditures' and 'Ѕарор Іукумати Їуміурии Тоїикистон аз 16 июни соли 2011 № 299...'). This loan carried a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and a 2% interest rate (see 'List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018'). The entire project had a cost of $27,857,000 million USD (see pg.32 of 'Foreign Aid Report 2011'). According to Asia-Plus, the Government of Tajikistan contributed $1.4 million USD to the project.

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend — through subsidiary loan agreement No. 2011(19) TOTAL (170) – 030 BT, dated July 20, 2011 — to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between July 20, 2011 and March 21, 2031 (see pg. 38 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of 'Consolidated financial statements...').

According to Asia-Plus, the loan was to be used to finance the construction of a new substation, Sughd-500, because the operating substation, Khujand-500, was not able to ensure regular electricity supplies to northern Tajikistan through the 550 kV South-North power transmission line (also Chinese-financed, project ID #39644 and #70910). Construction of the Sughd-500 substation was also intended to promote the implementation of the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Trade and Transmission Project (CASA 1000), which aimed to establish the necessary transmission and trading infrastructure and systems to enable a trade of surplus electricity from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Chinese company TBEA was responsible for implementation (see 'Ѕарор Іукумати Їуміурии Тоїикистон аз 16 июни соли 2011 № 299...'). According to Asia-Plus, the project was to begin in October 2011 and be finished by the end of the year. However, the completed project was not accepted by Tajikistan until March 15, 2013 (approved by the government on October 4, 2013) (see 'Постановление Правительства Республики Таджикистан от 4 октября 2013 года, № 444...').

This project involved the construction of a unified power system/single power grid through the construction of a new substation, Sughd-500, in the north of Tajikistan, near Jamoat Lolazor in Devashtich District. More locational details can be found at https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/52122/52122-001-rp-en.pdf.

The AIMS project ID is TJK/112373. Additionally, in October 2011, Minister of Finance Safarali Najmiddinov said that the loan had an annual interest rate of 2.0 percent for 33 years with a seven-year grace period, as relayed by Asia-Plus. However, according to the IMF in 2018, this loan had a maturity of 20 years, a grace period from 5 to 7 years, and an annual interest rate of 2% interest rate. With all this in mind, the interest rate was coded as 2%, the maturity period was coded 20 years, and the grace period was coded as 5 years (5 was the minimum, so this seemed to be the safer option).",Completion,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),ODA-like,Development,230,Energy,"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:cf9drzyFSUAJ:idbgbf.org/assets/2014/11/4/pptx/1958f46f-3318-48ed-b740-3b1a3fa2e709.pptx+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-b-ab, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/rl546mymjz3f15f/May%202018%20Flat%20Export%20from%20Tajikistan%20AIMS%20China%20Specific%20Projects.xlsx?dl=0, Other; https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/52122-001-dc.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.tj.undp.org/content/dam/tajikistan/docs/library/UNDP_TJK_Foreign_Aid_Report_2011_Eng.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/877071468303575509/pdf/891840NWP0P14700TJK0NOTE60final0web.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=ASIPLU0020111003e7a30005l&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks",6,,0,26463790,USD,0.94418159,1,28028284.26,26463790,,,,,Tajikistan,702,615,Tajikistan,TJK,TJ,762,923,TJK.4_1,Leninabad,TJK.4.4_1,Ghonchi,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Concessional,2,33,7,65.27,Sughd,,TRUE,FALSE

(XBJG), State-owned Company","China Eximbank loans 331,058,220 USD to Tajikistan for Dushanbe CHP-2 (Phase II) (linked to #54106)","Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases, according to the Diplomat. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas (see 'KEEPING WARM: Urban Heating Options in Tajikistan Summary Report'). According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter. 

On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $30 million USD loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (see pg. 30 of 'Проект «Повышение синергетического эффекта национальных программ стран-членов СНГ по ЭЭ и энергосбережению для повышения их энергетической безопасности» Страновое иследование (Таджикистан)'). According to Trend News Agency, the project's financing was on a 50-50 basis by the two banks. For purposes of recording, the two flows are separate; the China Eximbank contribution is captured by linked project ID#54106; the China Development Bank contribution is captured by linked project ID#71101. Other terms of this loan are unknown. 

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of 'Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...'; for the PBC loan amount, see 'Information on existing state investment projects'). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015, according to a 1/14/2015 Sputnik article.  

The RMB loan, captured by this project, was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see 'РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита'). The PBC loan (see linked project ID#71137) has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see 'List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018). The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD ('Information on existing state investment projects'). In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (see 'The May 2018 Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS'). 

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” (see pg. 39 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). 

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034 (pg. 39 of 'Consolidated financial statements...'). 

According to the Economic and Commercial Counselor Office in Tajikistan, the first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009. According to the 11/11/2015 Sputnik article, Phase 1 was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015, according to the 05/14/2015 Sputnik article. Phase 2 was completed on December 8, 2016, according to TBEA. 

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775. 

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The $30 million loan from China Eximbank and China Development Bank may not have covered the full cost of Phase 1 of the project. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as 'Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe.' The AIMS project ID is TJK/152048.

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment).

It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

China Eximbank agreed to provide a loan of $76.1175 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) for the project. 

The total cost of the new complex for the Institute of Technology of the University of Moratuwa (ITUM) at Diyagama, Homagama was $89.55 million (Rs 11.7 billion), and China Eximbank agreed to provide 85% of the funding required. Thus, China Eximbank’s estimated contribution = $89.55 million * 0.85 (or $76.1175 million). The BCL carried the following terms: 15-year maturity and 3-year grace period. 

The goal of the project was to increase student intake from 1050 to 3000 students annually and help middle level skilled technicians. The new ITUM complex was be relocated to Diyagama, Homagama. Lecture rooms, laboratories, workshops, libraries, administrative complexes, medical rooms, hostel facilities, and playgrounds were among the sections which will be developed. Under the project, the institute was to be provided with the required equipment, computers and machinery, along with training of the staff. 

However, the Government of Sri Lanka eventually abandoned its plan to implement the project with CATIC and China Eximbank financing. It ultimately completed the project with support from the International Construction Consortium (ICC).

The four energy power projects include Sukhi Kinari hydropower project, Dawood wind power project, Sahiwal coal-fired power plant, and Thar coal-power integrated project. Sinosure reported in 2018 that that the loan syndicate had in fact covered up to 85% of the total cost, providing 1.8 billion USD worth of export buyer credits. According to the ICBC website, ICBC alone provided 1.44 billion USD worth of export buyer credit. Other Chinese banks in the syndicate include Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China. Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co., Ltd and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd provided the equity funding. Sinosure has earlier committed to reduce the premium rate from 9% to 7%, increasing the business insurance coverage for overseas projects from 50% to 65%. For the purpose of this project, only the funding from ICBC has been recorded. For details on the equity portion, please see the linked project #54134. According to a March 2015 NEPRA document, the interest rate of the loan is 4.95%. For determination of the upfront tariff, the repayment period was assumed to be 10 years, and the grace period was assumed to be the same as the construction period, which is 4 years. This project has thus recorded the loan details as such. Project's first 660-MW capacity plant unit was reported a success with completion in a short 22 months and inaugurated May 2017 by the Prime Minister of Pakistan and has been linked to the national grid. Project also received a No Objection Certificate (NoC) from Pakistan's Environment Protection Department. Project's second 660-MW capacity plant is projected to begin electric generation in June 2017 at the reported available rate of 8.11 rupees per unit.",Completion,Export credits,OOF-like,Mixed (Some Development),230,Energy,"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiG5NymgI3hAhWOHTQIHazOBlQQFjAAegQIABAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnation.com.pk%2F25-May-2017%2Fshehbaz-speed-irked-by-delay-in-mining-reforms&usg=AOvVaw0WcJJ-8ck5HL4OzJ-socAs, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/16605/MP%20CR%20TS%20XW.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/Annex_III_CPEC.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASETRI0020170525ed5p0000h&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.ctei.cn/company/qyxx/201405/t20140521_1748450.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=IARPAK0020160604ec5v00002&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/2, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.tnc.com.cn/info/c-013003-d-3460451.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.icbc-ltd.com/icbc/en/newsupdates/icbc%20news/ICBCDedicatedtoSupportingPowerProjectsinChinaPakistanEconomicCorridor.htm, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.dagongcredit.com/uploadfile/2018/0919/20180919032315972.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://sd.sinosure.com.cn/shandong/xwzx/cbxm/2018/01/185444.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.icbc.com.cn/icbc/en/newsupdates/icbc%20news/icbcsupportsfirstlargeenergyprojectinthechinapakistaneconomiccorridor.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.nepra.org.pk/Licences/Licence%20Application/2015/Generation%20License%20App%20of%20Hunaneg%20Shdong%20RUYI.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://nepra.org.pk/Tariff/IPPs/Huaneng%20Shandong%20Ruyi%20(Pakistan)%20Energy%20(Private)%20Limited/TRF-308%20HUANENG%20UPFRONT%20COAL%20DETERMINATION%2031-03-2015%204385-87.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASGULF0020150131eb2100005&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASMESG0020170526ed5q0002a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://nepra.org.pk/Licences/Licence%20Application/2015/Generation%20License%20App%20of%20Hunaneg%20Shdong%20RUYI.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",17,,0,1800000000,USD,1.0239272,1,1757937478,1800000000,7/31/2015,,5/24/2017,,Pakistan,770,665,Pakistan,PAK,PK,586,564,PAK.7_1,Punjab,PAK.7.6_1,Multan,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,Concessional,4.95,10,4,27.54,Sahiwal,,TRUE,FALSE

Sachal Energy Development (Ptd) Limited is 100% owned by Arif Habib Corporation Limited. According to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost is 130.481 Million USD. The project achieved commercial operation on April 10, 2017. The debt-equity ratio of the project is 80:20. Hydrochina Corporation is the Offshore EPC Contractor and Hydrochina International Engineering Company Ltd Pakistan is the Onshore EPC Contractor for this project. Goldwind provided 33 Wind Turbine Generators with a capacity of 1.5 MW each. Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd entered into a foreign facility agreement with ICBC China on February 15, 2015 for an amount of 100 Million USD. This was later revised to 104.385 Million USD to reflect the 80% debt component of the total project cost. The interest rate is 6 Months LIBOR (1.4154%) + 3.75%. The repayment period of 10 years was determined according to the Debt Service Schedule on a 2018 document released by NEPRA. The project's inauguration ceremony was held on April 20 2015 during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Pakistan. According to ICBC, the project is the first private new energy loan project in Pakistan undertaken by China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE), and is also the first project to complete loan signing under CPEC. A 2013 Tariff Petition Determination document released by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority stated that the debt was to be shared between China CITIC Bank (80% of debt) and Askari Bank Limited (20% of debt). However, the Tariff Petition was ultimately rejected, which suggests that ICBC may have become the sole foreign financier to the project.

(NWPGCL) signed a joint venture agreement with China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) to construct the first phase of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Chinese translation:  孟加拉帕亚拉PAYRA2*660MW燃煤电站项目). CMC and NWPGCL formed the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) — a special purpose vehicle — to carry out this project. The Prime Ministers from both countries attended the June 2014 signing ceremony for the BCPCL. NWPGCL and CMC registered BCPCL on October 1, 2014. 

NWPGCL is a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). BPDP and CMC are both state-owned companies. The total cost of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant is $2.48 billion and it is reportedly being financed according to a 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio. NWPGCL and CMC each reportedly will provide 50% of the equity financing for this project. This project only tracks the debt funding. Project ID #56005 captures the equity funding for this project. China Eximbank covered the remaining 80% of the project through debt financing. On December 29, 2016, the China Eximbank and BCPCL signed a $1.984 billion loan agreement to support the construction of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. This loan reportedly carries the following terms: 19 year maturity, 4 year grace period, interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2% margin (which we estimate as 3.306% at the time of commitment since 1.306% was the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2016). The Government of Bangladesh provided a $1 billion sovereign guarantee for this loan on December 31, 2017. 

The Payra power plant is located in Dhankhali, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. This places the power plant along the north side of the Payra port, which will be renovated by the China Harbour Company and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (see Project ID #55522). Phase one of the project involves construction of units one and two. Each unit will have a capacity of 660 MW, so phase one has a combined capacity of 1320 MW.  In December 2017, BPDB contracted China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (NPEC) and China National Energy Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (CECC) to construct the power plants. The project was officially launched on October 27, 2018. The power plant became operational on January 13, 2020.  A consortium led by the China Datang Overseas Electric Technology and O&M Co. Ltd. will carry out operations and maintenance of the power plant.  Once operational, this power plant will sell energy to the BPDB at a cost of 6.56 BDT per unit of energy.  

The project site is located at Latitude: 22⁰ 59' 58' N and Longitude: 90⁰ 17' 58' E adjacent to the Kazol River or upstream of Rabnabad Channel at Dhankhali Union, Kalapara Upazila, Patuakhali District of Bangladesh. The site is spread across the Mouza: Modhupara, Char Nisanbaria and Nisanbaria. The site can be approached by a direct road from the nearby Dhaka – Kuakata Road (highway no. R880). The site is nearby the widely used Londa Kheya Ghat at Kalapara Upazila. Transport of heavy equipment can be made by adjacent river route. The site is approximately 13 km away from the nearest Upazila

STAFF_NOTE: Despite news articles that identify the lending terms for the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project as non-concessional, the grant element is 43.52%, so we code it as a concessional loan. We also code the project as having mixed (development and commercial) intent because the power plant is being partially financed via equity contributions (described in Project ID #56005). Other English names for the Payra Coal-fired Power Plant Project include 'Payra Power Hub' and the alternative spellings of “Pyra” and “Paira”. This project should not be confused with any of the joint-development agreements for the Payra 3600 MW LNG-to-Power Project signed by NWPGCL and Siemens (Germany). 

Also, note that there are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially via joint ventures between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially via China Eximbank loans. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project involves two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners have clarified that these plants are near each other, but they are distinct plants supporting a region-wide electrification campaign. 

These projects include: (1) Bangladesh’s Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) joint venture in October 2014 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (Phase 2). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56005. China Eximbank is funding phase one (units 1 and 2) of this project (see Project ID #52748). China Eximbank financing for phase two (units 3 and 4) is currently unspecified, with the most recent details record in Project ID #38245. 

(2) Bangladesh’s Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) and China’s China Energy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CEEC) established a joint venture in July 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of  Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Coal-Fired Power Plant (Ashuganj/ APSCL). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56547. CEEC will solicit a loan from the China Eximbank for the debt portion of the project. China Eximbank financing for this project is currently not captured in a stand-alone Project ID#. 

(3) Bangladesh’s Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and China’s NORINCO, which established a joint venture in November 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of 1320MW (2 x 660MW) MW Patuakhali Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant. The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56357. China Eximbank debt financing for the project is captured in Project ID#56402.

The Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park, and consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority. The coal will be imported. This project is one of the largest Priority Implementation Projects under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). According to a CPEC website last updated in 2017, the total investment for the project amounts to 2.085 billion USD, with a debt-equity ratio of 75:25. China Eximbank will be providing a loan of 1554.9 million USD dollar, which is the 75% debt component of the total 2.085 billion project cost. A Special Report on CPEC Projects from the Chinese embassy stated that as of October 2018, China Eximbank has disbursed 975 million USD (62.7% of total loan). Shareholders Powerchina Resources Ltd., who holds 51% shares and AMC, Qatar, who holds 49% shares, injected USD 346 million (i.e. 65.3% of total equity). The exact breakdown is unknown. For the purpose of this project, only the loan by China Eximbank is recorded. According to a February 2015 report from the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the interest rate of the loan is 4.95%. For determination of the upfront tariff, the repayment period was assumed to be 10 years, and the grace period was assumed to be the same as the construction period, which is 4 years. This project has thus recorded the loan details as such. On November 29th, 2017, Yao Jing, the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied the Prime Minister of Pakistan at the power generation ceremony of the first unit of the coal power plant at Port Qasim.

China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation, will be in charge of constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong. The repayment terms of the preferential buyer's credit are unclear. In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received the technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, would review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources (MPEMR).

This project involves the construction of a scientific research complex, a water quality analysis platform, a pilot study center, expert accommodations, and supporting facilities. 

The purpose of the project, which is taking place in Kandy (Sri Lanka’s second largest city) is to find a scientific solution to end chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKD). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has spread over 11 districts in Sri Lanka mainly due to the changes in various human activities and environmental factors. Over the past 30 years, it has become a major health issue. This disease is particularly acute among the farmers’ 40-60 age groups. Most researchers believe that the cause of CKD is drinking contaminated water. China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (CTCE) — a subsidiary of China Railway Group Ltd. — is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on September 28, 2018. Then, on July 17, 2009, the project successfully passed mid-term acceptance with the funder of the project (the Chinese Government’s Ministry of Commerce). The originally anticipated project completion date was May 2020.

Then, in 2015, during the visit of President of Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom to China, the Maldives and China formally agreed to gift a sea ambulance to the Maldives, according to PSM News. The sea ambulance was handed over to the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) on July 12, 2018, according to the Chinese Embassy and the Maldives Independent. Additionally, according to the Edition, Chinese Ambassador to Maldives Zhang Lizhong pledged that China would provide the required technical assistance for the boat. 

According to the Edition, the donated sea ambulance was larger and featured more medical facilities than the existing 25 Maldivian sea ambulances. According to the Maldives Independent, the 26-meter-long vessel was equipped with a “mini-medical theater,” including facilities for scans, electrocardiography tests, intravenous therapy, and oxygen delivery. The Chinese Embassy reported in July 2018 that the ambulance would improve the health and well-being of the Maldivian people. Many Maldivians live on remote islands and have poor medical conditions, so the ambulance would greatly improve the ability to transport and treat them. According to the Edition, medics had encountered drawbacks while transferring emergency patients from the atolls to Malé because of the length of travel, and the donation of the fully-equipped sea ambulance would help alleviate this problem. According to Sun Online, the Coast Guard was to manage to the new vessel.

A Chinese expert team trained the Maldivians in ambulance driving and use of the medical equipment. Training was completed by October 30, 2018, according an article in the Chinese Embassy in November 2018.

Ltd., State-owned Company; China International Water and Electrical Corporation, State-owned Company; Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), Government Agency",China provides USD129.25 million loan for Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Project in Nepal (linked to #34389),"On February 28, 2011, the Government of Nepal and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 640 million (equivalent to approximately $90 million) for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (or 上崔树里3A水电站项目 or 上崔树理3A水电站的建设). The terms of the loan were as follows: 1.75% interest rate, 25-year maturity, and a 5 year grace period. The Government of Nepal used the proceeds of the loan to develop an on-lending arrangement (through a “Subsidiary Loan Agreement”) with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) on April 15, 2011. These loan agreements went into effect on June 1, 2011. However, in 2013, the scope of the project was expanded and the face value of these loan agreements were increased to $114.7 million. The Upper Trishuli 3A hydroelectric power plant project involved the construction a 60 MW run-of-river (ROR) plant with annual energy generation of 460 GWh. The plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. On May 31, 2010, China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC) signed a commercial (EPC) contract with NEA to implement all civil, electro-mechanical, and hydro-mechanical works, including gradation of the 11.5 km long access road, construction of a steel bridge over Trishuli River, construction of temporary camp at headworks, and excavation of Adit no. 1 and head pond excavation. Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited (previously known as Northwest HydroConsulting Engineers) was selected as the contractor responsible for construction supervision. CGGC received a “Commencement of Work Order” on June 1, 2011. The project was initiated on November 23, 2011 and it encountered various delays due to disputes over whether to build powerhouse underground or overground, disputes about whether to increase the capacity of the project, damages to the access roads leading to the project site (resulting from landslides that were triggered by an April 2015 earthquake), and a blockade imposed by India. On May 26, 2019, the first unit of the plant was successfully connected to the grid.  The second unit was successfully connected to the grid later in 2019. The hydroelectric power plant was officially completed and inaugurated on November 18, 2019. The electricity that is now generated by the plant mainly serves people in Kathmandu and it reportedly fulfills seven percent of the country’s total electricity demand. STAFF_NOTE: The Government of Nepal’s Aid Information Management System (AMIS) records the face value of the China Eximbank loan as $129,241,702. However, the AMIS project record seems to combine the China Eximbank loan for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (this record) and the Upper Trishuli 3A-Kathmandu 220kV Transmission Line and 132kV Line Bay Extension Works Project (Project ID#38705). Therefore, we record the face value of the loan for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project as $114.7 million for the time being.

The financing arrangement is reportedly in line with the government's objective to sell down the project to the private sector, which requires the Project to be commercially attractive and financially viable. There is a minimum equity requirement of 20%. According to NEPRA, the EPC contractor of this project is a Joint Venture of Harbin Electric International and Habib Rafiq (Pvt.) Ltd, selected after an International Competitive Bidding process. It also indicates that Sinosure provides insurance for the project. The 70% debt component amounts to 558.73 million USD.

53820,Financial,Infrastructure Investments,TRUE,FALSE,2015,China,,,China commits a buyer's credit of USD 203.25 million to Pakistan for Lahore Orange Line Metro Train project (Linked to project #37280 and #54420),"The Government Pakistan first announced its interest in pursuing a project to develop a city-wide train system in the eastern city of Lahore on April 27, 2011. Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province. It is home to more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on April 20, 2015, a commercial contract for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: was signed between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)]. 

Shortly thereafter, on December 21, 2015, the China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement, a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement, and an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement. The BCL (Project ID#53820 and loan ID#BC-OLL-2015) has a 5.2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. The PBC (Project ID#37280 and loan ID#PBC-OLL15-34377) has a 20 year maturity and an unknown interest rate. The GCL (Project ID#54420 and loan ID#GCL-OLL15-20559) has a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of this “mixed credit” from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  

The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and  serve 250,000 passengers per day. CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. However, it encountered various delays.   

The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015.  Popular protests  prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project.  This project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019.

In September 2014, it was reported that China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) participated in the construction of Mubarek Natural Gas Processing Plant, a gas chemical complex created in the Kashkadarya (also spelled as Qashqadaryo) region of Uzbekistan. The project has a total cost of about2.5 billion. The plant is expected to produce 492,000 tons of polyethylene, 66,000 tons of condensate gas and tonnes of pyrolized petroleum a year. In May 2012, Uzbekneftegaz and Indorama Group (Singapore) established a joint venture based on the Mubarek Natural Gas Processing Plant (UzIndoramaGasChemical). CNPC signed a MOU with this joint venture in September of 2013 in order to participate in the gas chemical project, but their involvement became official in 2014. It is expected that each of the three involved companies will own 33.3% of the shares, although funding may also be secured from a loan from the Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan.

The project is funded by a loan agreement with the Bank of China, under the guarantee of the CNPC. When the three fields are developed, they will produce 869.6 million cubic meters of natural gas for exportation and 6,400 tons of gas condensate for domestic markets annually. The project was scheduled to begin in 2014, but construction began on May 30th, 2017.

In December 2017, the New Silk Road Oil and Gas Company Ltd (NSROG) founded as a joint venture by the CNPC and Uzbekneftegaz to oversee the project, started gas production in the Dengizkul field after the drilling of 2 new wells and repairing of 3 wells. NSROG announced that the Kojadavlat and Sharky Alat, specifically the 8 new wells and 3 damaged wells within these fields, were still under construction. A projected end date for the project has not been announced; however, construction was still occurring in September 2018.

It is planned that the complex will cover the entire value chain, from ore extraction to the production of high-quality steel grades. C1 and C2 reserves at the Massalskoe deposit amount to 729 million tonnes. In addition, Massalsky Mining and Processing Plant LLP and Exim Bank of China signed a framework agreement to finance the project, which cost 1.3 billion USD. In 2017, a feasibility study was performed on the construction site and was approved by Tau-Ken Samruk analysts. As of 2018, the funds from the Chinese EXIM bank are yet to be sent, and Tau-Ken Samruk describes the site as under design development, with an estimated completion year of 2025. Mazhit Turmagambetov, CEO of Tau-Ken Samruk JSC, commented during the signing ceremony: 'We want to produce our own high-quality steel, as currently Kazakhstan only imports the metal, bringing in around 1.5 million tonnes of steel annually. Our plant is not large by international standards, with an annual capacity of 940,000 tonnes. This is a new industry trend, because enterprises increasingly need to be flexible. They have to be ready to adapt at any moment and produce what is required by industry customers at any given time.' It is unclear whether China Exim Bank will finance the entire project cost, although Germany Trade & Invest reported that Exim Bank will finance 1,190 million USD in export credit, while Tau-Ken Samruk will finance 210 million USD.

Foreign Relent Loans received by NJHPC consist of Islamic Development Bank Loans IDB Istisna I &II of US$ 358 Million, China Exim Bank Loan I and II of US$ 1024 Million, Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development KFD loan I and II of US$ 74 Million, Saudi Fund for Development SFD Loan I and II of US$ 181 Million and OPEC Fund for International Development OFID Loan I and II of US$ 81 Million. The equity will be injected by Water & Power Development Authority, who is the sole sponsor of Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company Limited. The China Eximbank Loans are broken up into China Eximbank Loan 1 of 448 USD million and China Eximbank Loan 2 of 576 USD million. Both have a repayment period of 20 years and a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + 280 bps. As the relevant LIBOR interest rate was not explicitly identified in the document, the LIBOR rate at the time the project agreement was finalized or published would be used. As such, the 6 month LIBOR rate in March 2018 (2.32%) was used for the purpose of this project record. A interest rate of 5.12% is thus recorded. According to the Economic Affairs Division, as of 30th June 2017, the 448 USD million loan has been fully disbursed in the form of Preferential Buyer Credit, and 191.067 million USD of the 576 million USD loan has also been disbursed in the form of Preferential Buyer Credit. The same division also states that the 448 million USD loan was signed on 22 May 2013, and the 576 million USD loan was signed on 29 September 2016.",Implementation,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),OOF-like,Mixed (Some Development),230,Energy,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020030522dz5k0004a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/article/i/jyjl/j/201401/20140100476813.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/quarterly/fy15/Second/Chap-4.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://pk.chineseembassy.org/chn/zbgx/t406524.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASGULF0020170220ed2j00008&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://nepra.org.pk/Tariff/Petitions/2018/June%2018/Neelum%20Jhelum%20Hydro%20Power.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/budget/foreign_assistance_2015_16.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://tribune.com.pk/story/905807/cabinet-committee-deliberates-over-privatising-neelum-jhelum-project/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://finance.people.com.cn/n/2012/0808/c70846-18695814.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vults7c3kv89j45/BU_PITCH_ENGLISH_2018.xlsx?dl=0, Academic Journal Article; http://wapda.gov.pk/index.php/projects/hydro-power/o-m/neelum-jhelum, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/pubDetails.aspx, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/frmDetails.aspx, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.customstoday.com.pk/cost-surges-from-1-8b-to-4-21b-me-financiers-stop-433m-loan-for-neelum-jhelum-power-project-2/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mowp.gov.pk/gop/index.php?q=aHR0cDovLzE5Mi4xNjguNzAuMTM2L21vd3AvZnJtRGV0YWlscy5hc3B4P2lkPTc2JmFtcDtvcHQ9bmV3c2V2ZW50cw%3D%3D, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/press_releases.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://jwtz.org/a/news/2013/0530/5517.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ead.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/EAD/2018/Final%20PCP%20Year%20Book%202016-17%20.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/EAD/2018/Website%20Year%20Book%202015-2016.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/userfiles1/file/EAD/2018/Website%20Year%20Book%202015-2016.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/budget/Estimates_of_Foreign_Assistant_2017_18.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://weather.par.com.pk/china-firm-offers-50b-for-hydro-projects/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020030517dz5e00054&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.finance.gov.pk/budget/foreign_assistance_2016_17.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://wapda.gov.pk/vision2025/htmls_vision2025/njhp.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://energy.people.com.cn/GB/15916157.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks",26,,0,576000000,USD,0.97889,1,588421579.5,576000000,,,,,Pakistan,770,665,Pakistan,PAK,PK,586,564,PAK.1_1,Azad Kashmir,PAK.1.1_1,Azad Kashmir,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,5.12,20,8,36.15,,"Zulfiqar Ali Khan, Chairman of Wapda team",TRUE,FALSE

It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases, according to the Diplomat. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas (see 'KEEPING WARM: Urban Heating Options in Tajikistan Summary Report'). According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.
 
On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $30 million USD loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (see pg. 30 of 'Проект «Повышение синергетического эффекта национальных программ стран-членов СНГ по ЭЭ и энергосбережению для повышения их энергетической безопасности» Страновое иследование (Таджикистан)'). According to Trend News Agency, the project's financing was on a 50-50 basis by the two banks. For purposes of recording, this project only captures the $15 million USD from China Eximbank. For the China Development Bank contribution, please see linked project ID#71101. Other terms of this loan are unknown.

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of 'Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...'; for the PBC loan amount, see 'Information on existing state investment projects'). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015, according to a 1/14/2015 Sputnik article. 

The RMB loan was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see 'РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита'). The PBC loan has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see 'List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018'). The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD (see 'Information on existing state investment projects'). In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (see 'The May 2018 Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS').

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” (see pg. 39 of 'Consolidated financial statements...(. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of 'Consolidated financial statements...').

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034 (pg. 39 of 'Consolidated financial statements...').

According to the Economic and Commercial Counselor Office in Tajikistan, the first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009. According to the 11/11/2015 Sputnik article, Phase 1 was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015, according to the 05/14/2015 Sputnik article. Phase 2 was completed on December 8, 2016, according to TBEA.

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775.

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The $30 million loan from China Eximbank and China Development Bank may not have covered the full cost of Phase 1 of the project. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as 'Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe.' Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant. It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province. It is home to more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on April 20, 2015, a commercial contract for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: was signed between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)]. 

Shortly thereafter, on December 21, 2015, the China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement, a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement, and an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement. The BCL (Project ID#53820 and loan ID#BC-OLL-2015) has a 5.2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. The PBC (Project ID#37280 and loan ID#PBC-OLL15-34377) has a 20 year maturity and an unknown interest rate. The GCL (Project ID#54420 and loan ID#GCL-OLL15-20559) has a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of this “mixed credit” from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  

The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and  serve 250,000 passengers per day. CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. However, it encountered various delays.   

The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015.  Popular protests  prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project.  This project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019.

After that, China Road and Bridge Company submitted the engineering feasibility study report and preliminary design of the project to the Highway Bureau. Due to the large amount of project and the high total cost of the 487-kilometer Raikot-Islamabad project, China and Pakistan have decided to divide the project into three sections. The first section is Thakot-Havelian section, the second section is the Havelian to Islamabad section, and the third section is the Thakot-Raikot section. In 2016, the Pakistan-China Joint Cooperation Committee approved the repair for the section of the Thakot-Havelian of the eastern route with length of 136 kilometers. As part of CPEC, this project being developed by the Pakistani government will be financed by concessionary loans, with composite interest rates of 1.6%. The concessional loans are subsidized by the government of China, and are to be dispersed by the Exim Bank of China and the China Development Bank. China Communication Construction Co. Ltd. is the project contractor, with the executive agency being Pakistan National Highway Authority. A Pakistani Ministry of Finance annual status report 2015-16 records three loans provided by China to Pakistan for this KKH project. The first part is noted as GCL (Government Concessional Loan) with an amount of CNY 1,200.00 million (equivalent to 180.64 million USD). The second part is noted as BCL with an amount of 164.40 million USD. The last part is noted as PBC with an amount of 966.19 million USD. It is unclear what the latter two labels stand for or whether they are provided by the Chinese government. The three parts add up to USD1311 million, which is fairly close to the CPEC-reported amount of USD1366 million. This project captures the BCL component; for the other two fundings, see projects #52525 and #54424. Below are other sources that corroborate the financial details above: A Pakistani government project status report in May from 2017-18 records that China has committed only CNY1.2 billion on the project, which is significantly lower than the CPEC project total amount. During January 2017, it was reported that Pakistan's Under Communication Division contributed 600 million Pakistani rupee towards the project. According to the Pakistan Ministry of Finance Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2016-2017, the revised budget states that 20,500 million Pakistani rupees are likely to be disbursed in 2015-2016. In the Estimates of Foreign Assistance for 2017-2018, the Pakistan revised budget estimate predicts China to lend 11,137.010 million Pakistani rupees, or 82.96 million USD, to the project in 2016-2017. The budget estimate for 2017-2018 estimates China to lend 20,750 million Pakistani rupees, or 154.57 million USD, in that year. The 2016 Government of Pakistan Bond Prospectus lists the project cost as 1366 million USD, equal to the CPEC listed amount. The project is expected to be completed in 2018.

The pipeline starts at Gedaim on the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, runs through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and ends at Horgos in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The line A (#40833) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines (B (#40834) and C (#39997)) started their operation in 2010 and 2014 respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (#39955) runs through Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C are providing 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum, while Line D is still under construction. There are segments of each line constructed within Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Kazakhstan-China pipeline construction started in July 9 2008. This project records the financing of the Kazakhstan segment of Lines A and B. Project 39997 records the financing of the Kazakhstan segment of Line C. Line A and B starts on right bank of the Amu Darya River, near Turkmenistan/Uzbekistan border, and passes through the central region of Uzbekistan and southern region of Kazakhstan. Line A became operational in December 2009 (with a throughput capacity of 10 bcm per year), and Line B became operational in October 2010 (with a throughput capacity of 30 bcm per year). Line A and B's capacity has since been increased to 30 billion cubic meters of gas per year. (NOTE: In the 2018 base prospectus, the operational date of Line B was reported to be December 2012).

KTO and CNODC each owns 50% of the joint venture. The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network comprises three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are currently operational. The Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured in #39605. As at 31 December 2017, the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline had a total length of 962 km of pipe with diameters between 0.5 m and 1.8 m. In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline transported 12.3 million tonnes of crude oil. The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was completed in October 2009 with a total of 794 km of pipe with diameter of 813mm, and as at 31 December 2017, the length of the pipeline was 794.0 km and had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In the year ended 31 December 2017, the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline transported 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil. Pursuant to an agreement between the Company and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline increased to 20 million tonnes of crude oil in 2015, which is expected to enable the Company to accommodate the expected increased production at the Tengiz Field, as well as production at the Kashagan Field when commercial production achieves its expected potential. Ten companies supply oil to the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. This project records the financing to the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. On 12 August 2008, KCP entered into a U.S.$1.18 billion credit facility with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited and ING Bank N.V. with a term of ten years, subject to extension for up to five additional years. This credit facility was entered into for the purpose of financing construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches, three of which were drawn down during 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of U.S.$1.0 billion. The availability period for this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. Amounts borrowed under the facility accrued interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2% per annum until February 2013 and six-month LIBOR plus 4% per annum thereafter and are guaranteed by CNPC. As at 31 December 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was U.S.$403.9 million (including the capitalised interest) (KZT 134.3 billion). Based on the information above, the interest rate is recorded as 6 Month Libor in August 2008 (3.108%) + 2%, which is 5.108%. Maturity period is 10 years and grace period is 0.

The total cost of this project is $363 million and China Eximbank has agreed to cover 85% of the cost, so we estimate that the face value of the loan is $308.55 million.  This loan carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate and a 20 year year maturity. The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The contractor responsible for project implementation is Xinxing Construction Group. Reconstruction of the road started May 16, 2019. 

The reconstruction of the Merke-Burylbaytal road, 262 km long, is divided into 4 sections, of which the road section from Merke to Shu, 86 km long, will be listed under the first technical category with 4-lane traffic. The remaining 3 sections from the town of Shu to the village of Burybaytal with a length of 176 km will be listed under the technical category II with 2 lanes. The road will pass through the settlements of Tatti, Shu, Birlik. The reconstruction project involves the construction of 6 bridges, 3 overpasses over the railroad, 11 illuminated traffic intersections, 276 culverts, recreation areas, and auto pavilions. The project is expected to be completed in June 2022. 

According to an 2018 financial report from KazAvtoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company, it signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (Project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project  (Project ID#55016), the Merke-Burylbaital Road Reconstruction Project (Project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (Project ID# 54991). PBC loans from China Eximbank cover pay 85% of the total cost of a project, and we know from the total cost for each of these 4 projects (from a China MOFCOM source). Therefore, we can estimate the value of each PBC loan commitment by taking 85% of the total project cost. These calculations result in PBC loan value estimations of $434.35 million for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (Project ID#54990), $796 million for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project  (Project ID#55016),  $308.55 million for the the Merke-Burylbaital Road Reconstruction Project (Project ID#54989), and $147.05 million (85% of $173 million US dollars) for Astana Bypass Road (Project ID# 54991). The sum of these 4 estimate PBC loan values is $1,685,950,000,which is very close to $1,667,577,000 provided by KazAvtoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company its in 2018 financial report. All four of these loans carry a 2% interest rate and a 20 year year maturity, according to KazAvtoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company.

The loan package came in the form of a 405,800,000 USD loan (project #38342) and a separate 1,791,608,000 CNY loan (project #55046). Both loans have a 20 year repayment period and a 2% interest rate. This project is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative and one of a series of loans described in umbrella project #52873. June 2014, Bangladesh and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the construction of a tunnel under the Karnaphuli River. In June 2015, the road transport and bridges ministry of Bangladesh signed a US$705 million deal with China Communication Construction Company to implement the multi-lane tunnel to be constructed beneath the Karnaphuli River in Chittagong. This bridge will be located next to the existing Kalurghat railway bridge. The project will cost around 1.07 billion USD total, with the government of Bangladesh covering the remainder of the expenses. According to news reports from the Chinese state news agency Xinhua News, the construction started formally in Dec 5, 2017 after preliminary investigations, and was still in implementation as of Feb 2019. The project duration is expected to be 5 years. STAFF_NOTE: The grace period is unknown, however, this projects repayment period and interest period match the typical EXIM concessional loan terms, making a grace period of 5 years likely. The grace period is not included to avoid overstating the volume of Chinese giving.

Power Ltd. (RNPL) for the construction of the Patuakhali 1320 (2 x 600) MW Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant. RNPL is a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) created by Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and NORINCO Intl. in 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of this power plant. RPCL is a Bangladeshi state-owned electrification enterprise and NORINCO Intl. is a Chinese state-owned arms manufacturing company. The two state-owned enterprises registered their venture, RPCL-NORINCO Intl. Power Ltd. (RNPL) with the Government of Bangladesh’s Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms on December 27, 2017. 

The total cost of the project is approximately $2.5 billion. It is reportedly being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. RPCL and NORINCO each hold 50% equity shares in the project company. At the time of creation, RNPL had 200,000,000 BDT, with a maximum authorized capital of 400,000,000 BDT. The value of the Chinese equity funding is unclear. Since NORINCO held 50% of RNPL’s equity, the NORINCO funding may equal 100,000,000 BDT (approximately 1.2 million USD in December 2017). However, since the total project cost is 2.5 billion USD, and NORINCO owns half of the 30% equity share in the project company, NORINCO’s equity contribution could be as high at 15% of $2.5 billion, or $375 million USD. To avoid inaccurately representing the value of this investment, no transaction amount is recorded for the equity portion of this project for the time being (reported in Project ID #56357). 

China Eximbank is providing the debt financing for this project. Its loan to RNPL reportedly carries a 4% interest rate, 5 year grace period, and 20 year maturity. Project ID#56402 only captures the debt financing that came from the China Eximbank loan. The precise face value of the China Eximbank loan is unknown. However, RNPL has stated that the total project cost is $2.5 billion, and that 70% of the funding would come from the China Eximbank loan, which implies a  value of $1.75 billion. During the implementation of the 1320 (2 x 600) MW Patuakhali Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project, RNPL will construct a coal jetty, coal import-handling facilities, coal storage, the power plant, transmission facilities, roads, and the town surrounding the plant. The project will process 12273 tons of coal per day and sell power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). 

This power plant will operate on 915.74 acres of land. The plant will displace 350 families, so RPCL will set up a village with schools, shops, community centers, and mosques. On March 6, 2019, RNPL signed an EPC contract with NORINCO International Cooperation Ltd. and it issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to the EPC contractor on August 31, 2019. China Energy Engineering Group Tianjin Electric Power Construction Co.,Ltd. and Central Southern China Electric Power Design Institute of China Power Engineering Consulting Group Corporation are also involved in the design and implementation of the project.

However, the RPCL Managing Director announced the loan terms in November 2017, the same month the two firms signed the joint venture agreement, making 2017 the likely year in which the loan agreement was finalized.

Tthere are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially via joint ventures between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially via China Eximbank loans. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project involves two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners have clarified that these plants are near each other, but they are distinct plants supporting a region-wide electrification campaign.

These projects include: (1) Bangladesh’s Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) joint venture in October 2014 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (Phase 2). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56005. China Eximbank is funding phase one (units 1 and 2) of this project (see Project ID #52748).

Sirajganj 3 was supported by a syndicated loan that included the provision of debt from Bank of China (see Project ID#69033). 

The project is located about 15 km south-east of Sirajganj town and 130 km north-west of Dhaka. The closest settlements to the project site, Boroshimul & Ponchosona, are both located approximately 1 km from the power plant complex. Natural gas, the main fuel for the project, will be supplied by Petrobangla, and there are already existing pipelines servicing the power plant complex for the Sirajganj 1 Project. Power from the project will be evacuated to the national grid through existing 230kV switching station beside the project site.

Under the contract, the Exim Bank of China will meet 87.5 per cent of the financial requirements of the export supplier credit basis, while the rest will be arranged by Pakistan Railways. The repayment period for the credit is 15 years. The grace period will be three years and the interest rate will be about five per cent. China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation will export the 175 passenger carriages. Another Chinese Company, Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) will provide altogether 69 modern locomotive engines worth 100 million USD to Pakistan within a period of two years. Under the agreement, 15 complete locomotives are to be manufactured in China, while the rest of 54 will be assembled in Pakistan. China will provide both spare parts and technology. According to the annual report by EXIM Bank of China of 2003, in March that year the bank agreed to provide CNY650 million (roughly the equivalent of USD100 million at the conversion rate of the time) in supplier's credits for China National Machinery, and later in July, the bank signed a similar deal with Donfang Electric Corporation for two lines of supplier's credit, one of CNY680 million and the other of USD4.6 million, to support the latter's export of 69 locomotives. This project captures the export of locomotives, specifically the loan denominated in Chinese Yuan. For details of the loan denominated for the same project in USD, see project #56552. For details of the other project involving railway coaches, see #35120. These are linked together because they are signed and implemented simultaneously.
